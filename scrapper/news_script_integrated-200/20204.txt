I restaurant in a quiet backstreet in Seoul’s Gangnam district, the walls and part of the ceiling are covered in posters, postcards and key rings. On one shelf sits an enormous pyramid of coffee-cup sleeves. All the decorations show members of , South Korea’s most successful -pop act and the highest-grossing boy band in the world. They are gifts from fans around the world for whom the restaurant, where the band used to eat before they were famous, has become a site of pilgrimage.

So far, so unsurprising. Teenagers have projected their dreams onto -pop idols for years. But are not your average -pop band. Although their output has all the trappings of the genre—slick production, perfectly choreographed dance routines, rap interludes and ever-unconfirmed rumours about band members’ relationships—they do not conform to the stereotype of the flawless, manufactured idols who are expected to serve as blank screens for fans’ projections. Their producer, a graduate in aesthetics who set up his production company after years of working as a songwriter, has given them plenty of leeway in writing their songs and developing their own image.

That has led them down lyrical paths previously unseen in -pop. “Dionysus”, the final track of “Map of the soul: persona”, an album inspired by the theories of Carl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst, which topped charts all over the world in 2019, celebrates the creative potential of intoxication. The song, named for the Greek god of wine and other sensual pleasures, cuts to the heart of current changes in South Korea. Murray Stein, whose book about Jung inspired the album, likes to think of the Greek god as a “loosener”. Dionysus forces his followers to abandon rigid patterns of thought or behaviour that threaten to thwart their development.

Rather than put fans off, the public soul-searching and the references to Greek mythology and psychoanalysis have struck a chord in a way that no previous -pop act has ever managed. In 2019 were the highest-paid boy band in the world, selling out stadiums from Seoul to São Paulo. Their latest album topped the charts not just in South Korea but also in Britain and America. “The band’s story is very compelling,” says Hong Seok-kyeong of Seoul National University. “Just these seven ordinary boys who grow together.”

Contrary to common narratives in the West, the South Korean government’s efforts to promote Korean culture have had little to do with this success, says Ms Hong. “Western observers still find it hard to accept that a small east Asian country could generate this amount of cultural influence without a five-year plan from the government.” But that is precisely what appear to have done.Jaejoong, who is best known as a member of the Korean pop groups JYJ and TVXQ, wrote he wanted to "sincerely apologise" for his offensive post, saying he was simply scared that another wave of the virus could yet hit his country.The producers of “KPOP” have moved their casting search online as they prepare for a Broadway run next season.

The musical, originally seen Off-Broadway with a book by Jason Kim, music and lyrics by Helen Park and Max Vernon and direction by Teddy Bergman, will host an online virtual call seeking performers. Producers Tim Forbes and Joey Parnes had previously announced a nationwide casting search for a work session in November 2019.

The show, conceived by Kim and Woodshed Collective, premiered Off-Broadway in 2017.SEOUL, South Korea -- On Sunday afternoon, K-pop boy band SuperM thrilled fans in 109 countries with a spectacular live online performance, paving the way for a future of paid concerts.

SM Entertainment, South Korea's largest entertainment company, kicked off its first of four in the Beyond Live series of online K-pop concerts Sunday. No lining up in front of a stadium, no need to worry about securing an expensive seat to watch your favorite boy band, whose members come from several popular groups in Asia.

K-pop has marked a new era of live concerts with state-of-the-art AR technology and real-time communication amid the coronavirus outbreak. There was no audience in the auditorium. Instead, the concert was broadcast live to all paid-ticket holders around the world.

The concert received an explosive response from fans around the globe, recording 120 million hearts on social media through its broadcasting platform, Naver V Live.

SuperM first made its debut in Hollywood backed by Capital Records and SM Entertainment last fall. The band's intent was raising the bar for K-pop, according to Rolling Stone magazine. They recently completed a sold-out North American tour, taking them to various U.S. and Canadian cities. Now the group is quarantining together.

A total of 75,000 tickets were sold at $29.99, according to SM Entertainment. "Given that around 10,000 people come to an idol concert each time, it marks 7.5 times the amount of a regular offline concert, demonstrating the immense growth potential as a new concert business," noted the company.

The concert grabbed audiences’ attention using augmented reality (AR) effects, with the artists performing on stages before virtual reality backgrounds. During SuperM’s unveiling of their new song "Tiger Inside," for instance, an AR technology-implemented tiger ran across the stage.

In between sets, real-time communication was available. Viewers could write down questions, and SuperM members read out loud the messages on an online chat room. Some fans were even given a chance to ask questions through telecommunication during the show.

“It seems like the K-pop industry stepped up from a one-way experience of listening to good music to a whole new interaction experience,” Jiyun Choi, who purchased a merchandise bundle of photo cards and tickets for the concert, told ABC News. “The AR tigers in one of the stages represented its theme so well, which was probably only possible in an online concert environment.”

A Live Sync camera walk made the virtual concert seem more realistic, giving the audience the feeling that the artists were performing right in front of fans.

“SuperM restructured the choreography to bring up the potential of the camera following the action for their first live online concert, which really differentiated their stage from the original gig,” K-pop enthusiast Sunny Han told ABC News. “But I see there’s some room to improve on telecommunication between the artist and fans regarding translation and connectivity.”

Transmitting a live concert of this size was possible due to the stable internet in South Korea. But during the two-way chats with fans, there were brief moments of stutters for fans located abroad.

Following SuperM, the concert series is scheduled to continue with other SM Entertainment groups: WayV on May 3, NCT DREAM on May 10, and NCT 127 on May 17 local time.According to the report on the 2019 economic effects of hallyu, or the Korean Wave, released by the Korean Foundation for International Cultural Exchange (KOFICE), hallyu-related exports came to US$12.3 billion last year, up 22.4 percent from 2018."We cannot come up with the full member lineup for this album, but we still prepared a range of activities for Inner Circle," team leader Seungyoon was quoted by YG as saying, referring to the band's fan club.Over the last few weeks, the novel coronavirus pandemic has brought the K-pop scene to an unprecedented standstill. Most concerts and meetup events, both at home and abroad, have been cancelled or postponed, while weekly TV shows are being held without audiences.



The prolonged COVID-19 crisis may be taking a heavy toll on the whole K-pop industry, but small and midsized music labels in particular are feeling the pinch, as their business model relies heavily on tickets, physical albums and foreign funding. 



“Everything’s stopped. Smaller firms are dealing with almost zero revenue and all they can do is reduce costs as much as they can,” said Kim Gyo-sik, head of K-pop public relations agency HNSHQ.



“If the pandemic goes on for the long term, many of them will go bankrupt like dominos. It’s a matter of time. Even bigger labels won’t be able to recover.”





Big Hit, S.M., JYP and YG are considered the big four agencies that dominate the K-pop market, while runner-ups include Pledis, Starship, FNC and Cube. Amid K-pop’s soaring popularity around the world more recently, there has been a surge in smaller labels, mostly for newly formed bands. 



Compared to other industries, new groups are given more opportunities in the fast-paced K-pop industry, as many fans are eager to grow together from the very beginning with their new favorites. But it is also true that rookie groups are more vulnerable in hard times. 



In the early stage, it is crucial for them to build a stable fandom through various offline events that enable close interaction with fans. Many rookie groups also go global immediately upon their debut so they can build an international fandom right away.



Due to the current coronavirus outbreak, however, their budding careers have been almost put on hold.



Having debuted under Brave Entertainment in February, nine-piece boy band DKB is among them. The act had planned to start promotions in Japan, the biggest K-pop market outside Korea, in early April, but the plans were scrapped. 



“DKB was supposed to perform at KCON Japan and release its Japanese debut album on April 7. But everything went down the drain. It’s hard to measure the total amount of damage,” said Kang Heuk-cheol, the agency’s chief marketing officer. 



Kang expressed concerns over the newcomers’ futures, saying, “DKB should be laying the groundwork for their fandom right now.”



Eight-member Ateez, who debuted last year under KQ Entertainment, announced the rescheduling of all seven stops of its European tour, while VAV and ONF, two K-pop acts that have been enjoying international popularity recently, also postponed their world tour dates in Europe and the US, respectively. 



“We carried out a modest restructuring recently,” said Ryan Jhun, head of A Team Entertainment, which is home to VAV. “Our planned debut of a new girl band has also been put on hold.”



Bracing for the blow, many K-pop acts are now turning to online promotions. 



TOO, a rookie act under n.CH Entertainment, livestreamed its media showcase via YouTube on Monday, while fellow rookie group MCND from Top Media held a debut event online by holding a live chat with fans. Other bands like Newkid, GWSN, D-Crunch and 3YE also share self-made videos to keep communicating with fans. 



“Going online may be far better than doing nothing, but it’s not helpful for immediate profits,” said Hwang Jeong-gi, head of talent agency JG Star Entertainment. “It’s a long-term investment.” 



He said some agencies are considering charging fees for online events like fan meetings, and a growing number of platform operators are already reaching out for potential collaborations. 



“This is a difficult time for all of us, and small businesses should join forces and come up with a more practical win-win plan for survival,” he added. 



By Hong Dam-young (lotus@heraldcorp.com)The album, titled "Chromatica," has a track titled "Sour Candy," which features none other than the queens of Blackpink.

Blackpink -- which consists of members Jennie, Lisa, Rosé and Jisoo -- has consistently dominated the music charts not only in South Korea, but also in the US , with hits like "Kill This Love" and "DDU-DU-DDU-DU."

Gaga's new 16-track album also includes "Stupid Love," which has already been released, and a song featuring Elton John called "Sine From Above." Another song, titled "Rain On Me," features Ariana Grande.

But many people sounding off in response to Gaga's tweet appear to be big Blackpink fans.Woo Ji-yoon has quit K-pop duo Bolbbalgan 4 (BOL4) after four years, citing concerns about the direction of her career in the future.

 In a handwritten letter, Woo, the guitarist and backup vocalist, thanked her fans for their love and support but admitted she had been thinking about leaving for some time.

 "It was a process of contemplating about my future seriously, and it occurred to me that now is an important time to embark on a new challenge, before it's too late," she said. 

 Woo said co-member Ahn Ji-young and their agency Shofar Music had tried to persuade her to stay, but they respected her decision.

 "What I started in high school for fun has now grown into a group that many people pay attention to and root for, and I want to let you know that BOL4 is a precious memory to me," she said. 

 "Although I won't be able to continue on as a member, I will remain as a fan and a friend who fully supports BOL4. Thank you for being with me during my brightest moments. I love you."

 Shofar Music released a statement on Thursday, saying: "Woo expressed her intention to leave BOL4 due to concerns about her career path, and we have discussed this matter many times for a long time. In the end, we decided to respect her decision.

 "BOL4 will continue under the same name with Ahn as its only member, without recruiting additional members. Ahn and Woo will continue to be colleagues and friends who support the paths they each take."

 The agency also hinted at BOL4's next album, which is expected in May.

 Ahn, the duo's vocalist, said she was taken aback when Woo first told her about the departure, but came to understand her co-member.

 "I was upset at first," Ahn said in a handwritten letter to BOL4 fans. "But I came to understand that it must have been difficult for Woo to decide to take on a new challenge. So I decided to respect her decision. 

 "I've known Woo for almost a decade and she has always done her absolute best for the sake of BOL4. Now it's my turn to support her as a friend. Although you won't be able to see us performing together in the future, we will support each other and share news with our fans from time to time."

 Ahn also shared concerns about having to continue BOL4 on her own. "It's true that I'm anxious and worried about having to perform on my own, but I think it's time to take on more responsibility and just do my part."

 BOL4 debuted in 2016 and released hit songs including "Galaxy," "Travel" and "Workaholic."Streaming giant YouTube will release the first documentary on a K-pop girl group through YouTube Originals this month.

It will also give a closer look into the group's first North American Tour, which was part of "TWICE WOLRD TOUR 2019 'TWICELIGHTS.'"

The group shot to stardom in the following years, releasing hits like "Like OOH-AHH" (2015), "LIKEY" (2017) and "FANCY" (2019).



As a promotion for the documentary, the group will hold a fan event "Premiere Live Stream" at 2 p.m. on April 28 to interact with global fans through the platform.Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, producers of KPOP: The Broadway Musical (which is hoping to stage its Broadway premiere during the 2020-21 season) have now launched an extensive virtual open casting call.

The 23-year-old’s debut single “Bomb” was a great way to showcase her talent as a performer, as the video for the energetic Brazilian beat-inspired electro-pop tune had racked up over 12 million views on YouTube as of Wednesday.



And last week, she released her first EP, “Do or Die,” encompassing all of her work so far. 



“There have been a lot of first experiences for a lot of things,” the singer told The Korea Herald about her life as a singer.



“I think I’ve learned to be more grateful for things because even though I’m just one soloist, we have this incredible hard-working team behind me that does everything”



Wearing a denim jacket decorated with a design of classic children’s cartoon cat and mouse Tom and Jerry -- the inspiration behind her new song “Kitty Run” -- the singer recalled her first encounter with K-pop while in middle school.



“When I was around 11 or 12, my hometown best friend introduced me to K-pop and I fell in love with SHINee. They were the first group I loved when they first debuted in 2008.



“And I thought to myself, one day I want to try to do what they are doing.”



Though born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she spent most of her life, her music tastes have geared toward Korea, where her mother is from. 



“It‘s fair to say that a lot of people I went to school with loved country music, cowboy boots and trucks. And then there was me, being like, ‘I like Korean music.’”





If you look closely enough, her Southern roots can be found here and there, especially in her choice of footwear in music videos. 



“It wasn’t really shown a lot in the ‘Do or Die’ music video, but there was a scene where I have thigh-high silver cowboy boots, and I thought that’s a homage to back home,” she said, before adding, “Yee-haw.”



Her cyberpunk-inspired videos have been a big hit on YouTube, impressing viewers with the heavily choreographed dance moves all while sporting tall platform boots.



AleXa, who has been dancing since 2 years old, has gotten into the swing of dancing in boots and says she can even run in them. But they are not as light as she makes them out to be.



“Those things are so heavy if you swing them around and hit somebody, I think they can get a concussion,” she laughed.









“We work very closely with the famous Swedish producing team called EKKO Music Rights, not just sit back and listen to ‘Oh, how about this demo.’ We were able to give our input into what kind of sound we want because we think very visually,” she said.



AleXa’s team had a concept board at the ready, and already had an idea of what they wanted the story for the video to be, how they wanted it to flow, as well as the peaks and falls of the video while the music was made.



“‘Let’s make a movie in five minutes’ is kind of our goal with the music video and then we interpret that through the song.”



The journey to her debut has taken several auditions as well as taking part in Mnet’s reality competition show “Produce 48.” But she’s happy to have ended up at ZB Label -- a subsidiary label launched by K-pop music video production company Zanbyros.



“Not just with music, but conceptually, sound-wise of course and visually, this company is so open-minded and so creative. I don’t think at this point I can see myself in a different company. Zanybros is my second home at this point.”



By Yim Hyun-su ( The entertainer doesn’t shy away from the fact that she focuses on the visual aspects, as her music was made after the video had been visualized and conceptualized with a storyboard.“We work very closely with the famous Swedish producing team called EKKO Music Rights, not just sit back and listen to ‘Oh, how about this demo.’ We were able to give our input into what kind of sound we want because we think very visually,” she said.AleXa’s team had a concept board at the ready, and already had an idea of what they wanted the story for the video to be, how they wanted it to flow, as well as the peaks and falls of the video while the music was made.“‘Let’s make a movie in five minutes’ is kind of our goal with the music video and then we interpret that through the song.”The journey to her debut has taken several auditions as well as taking part in Mnet’s reality competition show “Produce 48.” But she’s happy to have ended up at ZB Label -- a subsidiary label launched by K-pop music video production company Zanbyros.“Not just with music, but conceptually, sound-wise of course and visually, this company is so open-minded and so creative.

The Toronto native was just cleaning her closet and putting some outfits together when she realized that one of them looked eerily similar to the black-and-white cover art of the band’s 2019 Spinning Top EP. “After that, I tweaked the outfit a little bit to match the album more, then took a quick picture and posted it,” she tells Teen Vogue. “I never would have expected it to blow up as it did.”

But, well, it certainly did. Hayeon’s Spinning Top-inspired outfit, which she posted to her Twitter on March 28, rapidly went viral among GOT7’s fans, known collectively as iGot7 or Ahgase. While sharing her ‘fit, Hayeon also challenged fellow fans to “dress like your favorite GOT7 album,” which later spurred the hashtag GOT7AlbumFitChallenge. A few weeks later, her original post has been liked over 5,000 times, retweeted over 1,000 times, and emulated dozens of times as other K-pop fandoms joined the trend.

Originally just a challenge to Ahgases, Hayeon’s singular OOTD post spread across fandoms. “I was genuinely surprised when I saw how big it became in other fandoms, then even on other social media platforms,” Hayeon, who asked for only her given name to be used in this piece, says. For non-K-pop fans, engaging with physical music albums in 2020 may seem a bit odd. With complex and beautiful cover art, these CDs are seen as treasured, collectible items in the world of K-pop.

This isn't the first time fans have looked to album covers (or their favorite K-pop acts in general) for outfit inspiration. But Hayeon posting her album-to-outfit idea just as many countries started to take social distancing and lockdown precautions in light of the coronavirus pandemic, gave fans a chance to do so with a newly found sense of community. And so, stylish stans rapidly latched onto the trend and began bringing the designs of their favorite discs to life.In the last few years, K-pop’s popularity has moved well beyond its traditional Asian heartland to become a global phenomenon. Run by entertainment agency Big Hit, Seoul-based boy band BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018, according to IFPI’s global music chart; the seven-member collective topped both the US Billboard 200 and UK Official Charts with their albums Love Yourself: Tear and Love Yourself: Answer. They swiftly sold out their concerts at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California, and Wembley Stadium in London as part of a record-breaking world tour, and 2019 saw them break even more records when their EP Map Of The Soul: Persona topped the US charts. The achievement tied the group with The Beatles for the most Billboard 200 No.1s in under a year.

Following close on BTS’ heels are the hugely successful four-member girl group BLACKPINK, who, also in 2019, broke numerous streaming records and played Coachella. Then there’s the supergroup SuperM, who became the first K-pop act to debut at the top of the US albums chart. Elsewhere, boy bands NCT 127 and Monsta X both played to packed crowds on western stadium tours and appeared on US chat shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Late Show With James Corden and Good Morning America. Collectively, K-pop’s leading lights have achieved an astonishing level of success for a genre that’s still sung predominantly in its native Korean language.

As with all well-established genres, there is plenty of talent beyond the main stars. Local favorites, cult concerns, reality-produced phenomenons, experimental cutting-edge collectives, and talented if – till now – relatively unknown bands round out a constantly evolving scene defined by its high-gloss music videos, meticulously choreographed dance moves, colorful fashions, variety-show comedic turns, and ebulliently catchy tunes. But with new groups debuting weekly, the sheer amount of music on offer can make discovery daunting to the newly-initiated.

Here, then, is everything you need to know about K-pop, music’s most exciting scene.

Currently, the world’s most successful boy band, BTS’ popularity was no stroke of luck: their phenomenally loyal fans (known collectively as ARMY, for “Adorable Representative MC For Youth”) have been blessed with a group that embodies charm, hard work, and charisma. Its seven members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook – collectively deliver an ebullient, rap-inflected brand of pop music rich with messages of self-acceptance and tolerance. Their 2019, Kelsey-assisted hit ‘Boy With Love’ and 2018’s smash hit single ‘Fake Love’ are both good places to start. Or try 2017’s shimmering mid-tempo ballad ‘Spring Day’.

2019 was BLACKPINK’s international breakout year. The four-member girl group reached No.24 in the US Billboard 200 with the Kill This Love EP, performed to packed-out stadiums across the world and were regular faces on US TV. The international make-up of the band – Jennie grew up in New Zealand, Rose was born in New Zealand but brought up in Australia, and Lisa was born and raised in her native Thailand – gives them the advantage of being able to communicate freely with fans (known as Blinks) across the world. BLACKPINK’s name gives a clue to their musical style: try the sassy, hard-hitting club bangers ‘Ddu-Du Ddu-Du’ (which broke records to become K-pop’s most streamed music video) and ‘Kill This Love’ for evidence of their dark, sassy side, or the bubblegum pop of ‘As If It’s Your Last’ for evidence of their ebullient pink-leaning side.

Despite K-pop’s recent international success, it goes without saying that South Korea remains the genre’s heartland, with local favourites typically coming from one of three agencies: YG Entertainment (whose roster includes BLACKPINK), JYP Entertainment and SM Entertainment. Under the latter’s banner are EXO, a nine-member boy band of mixed South Korean and Chinese descent. Try the boogie-fied raunch of 2018’s ‘Tempo’, the trap-influenced ‘Monster’ or ‘Call Me Baby’, which presents a Teddy Riley-produced update of New Jack Swing, for three great examples of their R&B-laced pop and hard-hitting dance moves.

JYP Entertainment currently has South Korea’s most popular female collective (and, with them, the much-coveted title of “Nation’s Girl Group”) Twice as their hottest property. With three of its nine members being of Japanese descent, the neighboring country has also fallen hard for their charms. ‘TT’ and ‘Likey’ are both prime examples of the group’s signature brand of cutesy pop and easy-to-emulate dance routines, while ‘Feel Special’ shows them taking a more mature direction.

One of K-pop’s greatest attractions is its willingness to push creative boundaries, and SM Entertainment has been behind some of the genre’s most groundbreaking experiments. Formed in 2016, boy band NCT are a collective that boasts unlimited members from multiple nationalities. Split into ever-shifting sub-units (consisting of 21 members and four sub-units at the time of writing), the band’s sound is often as out-there as its concept. NCT U’s ‘The 7th Sense’, NCT 127’s ‘Cherry Bomb’ and NCT Dream’s ‘Boom’ show three sides of the group’s cutting-edge fashions, choreography, and music.

Also under SM Entertainment, the five-member girl group Red Velvet is behind some of the most quirky, leftfield, and downright entertaining pop music of the last few years. Another group whose name reveals their musical style, their “Velvet” side is expressed in smooth R&B jams such as ‘Bad Boy’; look to their “Red” side, and the likes of ‘Russian Roulette’ and ‘Peek-A-Boo’, for your fix of kooky experimental pop.

South Korea has its own iterations of the likes of The X Factor and American Idol, with reality TV shows giving birth to a number of the country’s most successful groups. Created through the survival program No.Mercy, seven-member boy band Monsta X, has been one of the genre’s biggest recent international successes. Their signature hip-hop sound is augmented with healthy doses of EDM on ‘Shoot Out’ and ‘All In’, while 2019’s French Montana-guesting ‘Who Do You Love’ goes straight for the heart of the dancefloor.

The hugely-popular Produce series, meanwhile, has birthed some of South Korea’s biggest groups, among them the short-lived IOI and Wanna One (both were on fixed contracts). The 2018 season saw TV channel Mnet combine forces with the megalithic J-pop group AKB48 to provide the contestants, with the victors going on to became 12-strong girl group IZ*ONE. Their mix of Japanese and South Korean members led to huge popularity in both countries. Two immensely catchy South Korean singles, ‘La Vie En Rose’ and ‘Violetta’ demonstrate their graceful charm and sharp dance moves, while outstanding album track ‘Highlight’ re-frames the girls as deep house heroines.

Six-member ONEUS has made significant waves since its January 2019 debut. Straddling multiple musical styles and featuring playful nods to their heritage, their music videos have amassed impressive viewing figures considering the relatively minor status of their agency, RBW. Look to the strident electro and classic K-pop stylings of their debut, ‘Valkyrie’, the stunning gothic visuals and sweet guitar riffs of ‘Twilight’ or the hip-hop leanings and traditional South Korean embellishments of recent track ‘LIT’ for evidence of why they’re one of the most exciting prospects in a talent-rich scene.

Masterminded by the agency Blockberry Creative, 12-member girl group LOONA, whose name translates as “Girl Of The Month”, were slowly revealed over an 18-month period. Each member was introduced by a single album and music video before their much-anticipated debut in August 2018. That extended introduction period (a first for K-pop), alongside the complex mythology that continues to pepper the group’s videos, has resulted in a small but rabid following of fans – known as Orbits – both inside and outside of South Korea. 2019’s ‘Butterfly’, the group’s debut single, ‘Hi High’, and ‘Girl Front’, by the pre-LOONA sub-unit Odd Eye Circle, reveal a versatile collective as at home performing hard-hitting dance moves and pushing musical boundaries as they are at channeling effervescent pop.

While a huge part of K-pop’s appeal lies in its sense of freshness and trend-setting production, there remains a veritable treasure trove of classics waiting to be discovered. Big Bang were the reigning kings of K-pop until their military enlistment began in 2017 (all male South Koreans between the ages of 18 and 28 are required to complete around two years of service). Created by YG Entertainment, their hip-hop-leaning mix of high-energy club bangers and R&B, exemplified by ‘Bang Bang Bang’, ‘FXXK IT’ and ‘Bad Boy’, come accompanied by some of the genre’s most highly-stylized and jaw-droppingly brilliant videos. Though recently involved in serious controversy (they were reduced to a quartet following a string of allegations against member Seungri during the Burning Sun scandal), the group blazed a trail for K-pop’s international popularity and they should be a force once more upon their much-anticipated return.

The original “Nation’s Girl Group”, Girls’ Generation (or SNSD, as they are known in South Korea) have left an indelible mark on the K-pop scene. Founded by SM Entertainment, the nine-member group’s squeaky-clean image and bright, bubbly, high-energy brand of pop – typified by such enduring classics as ‘Gee’, ‘Genie’ and ‘I Got A Boy’ – broke down the previously intractable Japanese market while providing a template for groups such as Twice to follow. Though rarely performing together nowadays, Girls’ Generation retains a legion of fans, while lead vocalist Taeyeon continues to thrive as one of South Korea’s most successful solo artists.

Included in the lineup of the "Live K Concert" are girl bands MAMAMOO and APRIL, duo B.O.Y and soloist Kim Jae-hwan, according to performance agency SPRING ENT, Friday. 



The organizer is Korea's No.2 mobile carrier KT. It decided to hold the event for people who have been virtually unable to enjoy cultural life following the virus outbreak. 



The gig will be live-streamed on KT's IPTV (internet protocol television) service Olleh tv and Seezn, the OTT (over the top) service, at 6 p.m. (KST). There will be no audience at the concert ― which will take place at the YES24 Live Hall in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul ― because of social distancing.



"Although the concert has no audience on the spot, we will attempt to bring realism to the viewers with the help of sound, settings and other factors," KT was quoted as saying. 



Viewer donations will be given to humanitarian non-governmental organization (NGO) GoodNeighbors to help people battle the virus. As of Friday, Korea had 10,062 confirmed cases and 174 deaths."Our primary goal would be to win the ticket to the 'Kingdom' competition show ... But the bigger goal for us is to become a good team who can contribute to the development of the K-pop market," The Boyz said at the start of the online press conference.K-pop is fiercely revving up its presence on the global music scene, with myriad singers attaining unprecedented international stardom. But there are so-called "K-pop makers" who receive far less limelight than they deserve, despite their contributions to the birth of megastars. 

 Vocal trainer Kim Sung-eun, teacher of big-name artists including BTS, TWICE and Kang Daniel, is one such figure. 

 "In the past, I felt like an empty shell or an outsider because I couldn't be judged by who I am. People evaluate a vocal trainer based on the singers' performances," Kim said during a recent interview with The Korea Times at the headquarters of WIP Company in Mapo-gu, Seoul. WIP is a K-pop academy that Kim established in 2011.

 "I couldn't escape from the sense of vanity, as I should hand down what I have to the others to earn my recognition."

 Kim, who has had a burning passion for music since her youth, jump-started her music career as a singer in 2003, after featuring in hip-hop musician MC Sniper's "Korean."



 

 Thanks to her matchless knack for singing, she was soon offered another job as a vocal trainer for idol stars. Her first student was K-pop girl group BABYVOX Re. V, which debuted in 2007. As her students made progress in singing, more people asked Kim for help. 

 Since then, she has taught a flurry of K-pop stars ― such as diva Sunmi and Sandeul of boy band B1A4 ― and now has more than 15 years' experience under her belt. She said she did not have a sense of duty at first, but now has fallen in love with her work. 

 "As I grew older, I learned to let things go and met legions of good people in the industry who helped me fill my void," Kim, whose stage name is AG Sungeun, said. "Initially, it was demanding for me to interact with the singers and the officials from the music labels, but now we are close enough to have private gatherings and give a hand to each other when needed." 



She added: "What I also like about my job is that I can appreciate all the numbers that are not included in an album. I am fond of the lesson time as well, which allows the singers to unveil their most authentic and candid side as they endeavor to make up for a deficiency." 

 Reflecting her satisfaction on her career, Kim looked bright and vibrant during the two-hour interview. Sporting flower-patterned blouse and denim, she did not wipe the radiant smile off her face as she talked about her life. 

 The vocal trainer said one of her "good people" is Jin of K-pop juggernaut BTS. She revealed she had singing lessons with three BTS members ― Jin, V and Jungkook ― for more than a year before the band's debut in 2013. 

 "When Jin was an idol trainee at Big Hit Entertainment, he practiced singing Asher Book's 'Try' (2006) with me during a lesson, which he could barely pull off back then. But after several years, he suddenly sent me his new record of that track with the accompaniment. Then he said, 'Please listen to this. Didn't I improve?' He was so proficient, but what touched me more was his attitude. Despite being a superstar with hectic schedules, he still strives for better." 

 Kim added that TWICE's Jihyo is full of passion and desire as well. 



"She recently played an acoustic gig at a little theater as a part of TWICE's 'Melody project' and successfully live-performed five challenging tracks with all-band sounds. I think she pushed the envelope," Kim said. 

 When asked if there are certain types of students that are easier to train, Kim nodded. 

 "Flexibility in attitude and core muscle matters the most," she said. "The training usually starts from fixing the problems of each student and the upgrading in techniques comes next. But some students feel uneasy during this period, fearing that they are not making improvements in a new way I taught. But they should be more open-minded and embrace the changes instead of sticking to their own belief. If core muscle needed for singing is flexible, it facilitates the learning too." 

 Kim also moved to give her own definition of a "good singer." Defying a common belief that singers who hit the high notes with natural voices are usually the best, she underscored "emotions." 

 "If a singer can resonate with the listeners by fluently expressing their emotions in a song while making good use of 'tools' such as tune and lyrics, he is the best artist for me," she said. "Hitting high notes is merely a technique. There are numerous singers who can still rock the track with their other merits, without giving out an extremely high-pitched sound." 



Kim praised soloists IU, Kang Daniel for their prowess and endeavor, among many others. 

 "Many people know IU excels in singing high-pitched tones and has a velvety voice, but don't realize how well she gets into the rhythm or how skillfully she epitomizes her emotions in a song," Kim said. "In the case of Kang Daniel, I was surprised by his vocals after listening to one of his songs without any auto tune. He was a rapper/dancer of now-defunct boy band Wanna One, but his sound was so deep and his ability to interpret music was great. Kang is very serious about his music and puts much effort into his work as well."

 Although the K-pop scene is jam-packed with talented singers, many still believe that so-called "idols" are subpar. 

 "The K-pop industry has its own distinctive criteria when evaluating a singer," she said. "We put emphasis on performances and a singer is required to live-perform a gig while making powerful dance movements. In fact, the lead vocalists of each group can pull off diverse music genres with proficiency, but they lack opportunities to show themselves off." 

 Kim wrapped up the interview by disclosing her goals. 

 "I hope my students can accomplish musical feats and the teachers of WIP Company grasp more chances to teach," she said. "These days, it was tough for me to take good care of myself as I had to manage other people around me. So now, I personally want to learn singing more and hone my skills since I am still inadequate. I want to seek ways to upgrade myself."Is China lifting its unofficial ban on K-pop? 

 The expectation is high after K-pop singers are to be invited to appear in its online concert "We are the World 2020," scheduled for April 30. It is touted as the Chinese version of the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert for famine-stricken Africa, with the goal of helping victims of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 

 The organizer is FREEGOS & KVLY ― a joint venture recently established by Korean media commerce platform KVLY and FREEGOS Entertainment, China's largest performance agency.

 It was revealed last week that the state-affiliated China Benevolent General Association will send official invitations to Korean music labels. The concert does not have an audience but will be live-streamed on YouTube and Chinese online platforms. It would be the first time that China has opened up all its online platforms for Korean content since constraints began in 2016. 

 It is a good sign but some experts warn that it is too early to assume China is reversing its K-pop ban. 

 "It seems premature to judge whether the concert is a positive indication of the alleviation," Lim Dae-geun, a professor of Chinese Cinema Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS), told The Korea Times. "Korea keeps talking about the lifting, but China is unlikely to make a public announcement concerning the removal, because it has never officially admitted to the constraint."

 Beijing is widely regarded to have started blocking K-pop after Seoul allowed the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system ― the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ― on Korean soil. China unsuccessfully pressured Korea against the deployment. 

 Korean films, dramas and performances have been practically prohibited in China. In the case of K-pop, even phenomenal boy band BTS could not perform there last year during its globe-trotting tour of 23 cities.

 "The event is more likely a 'compensation' from Beijing to appreciate Seoul for not banning the entry of its people when the coronavirus hit the apex in China," Lim said, comparing it to Korea's gift of millions of face masks to China, whose city Wuhan is the epicenter of COVID-19.

 "The organizer might have to work closely with the Chinese government to gear up for the concert," Lim said. 



Lim Jin-hee, a research professor at Wonkwang University's Korean Chinese Relations Institute, said the event does not seem to have a big meaning. 

 "It looks like a concert of the Chinese, by the Chinese and for the Chinese," he said. "K-pop stars can't be the protagonists of such an event. China seemingly wants to boast its power and influence as a global leader by showing the rest of the world that it is drawing people's attention to a global disaster and leading the problem-solving." 

 He added: "The country appears to believe it can reduce criticisms toward it, if it transforms itself into a 'fixer.'" 

 Another expert says the gig can be thought of as a gift from China ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's possible visit to Seoul this year. 

 "Cultural exchange can be an effective and less problematic present," Roh Dong-ryeol, a professor of Media & Communications at Sungshin Women's University, said in an email interview with The Korea Times. "We should see how successfully the concert ends and whether follow-up events will be organized to discuss the future of the two countries."

 Nonetheless, the experts agreed that Korea could capitalize on the event to promote the subsequent cultural exchange with China. 

 "Korea should actively participate in an event like this first, so that it can make its own offer in the coming days," Roh said. 

 G-dragon of K-pop giant BIGBANG is "expected to be up on the stage," but his appearance has not been confirmed. The K-pop stars who will appear are slated to perform in Seoul, while the Chinese singers will stage their gigs in Shenzhen in Guangdong Province. Artists hailing from Europe and other countries are likely to film their performances in Macau.Night clubs and bars here were on high alert after it was revealed Tuesday that a female bar employee at one of Seoul’s biggest bar districts was confirmed with COVID-19.The employee, 36, whose test results turned out to be positive last Thursday, is believed to have contracted the COVID-19 after coming into contact with a virus patient, Yoon Hak of K-pop group Supernova, on March 26.The singer, 37, was diagnosed with the infection on April 1 and has since been in isolation at a medical center in Seoul, according to Seocho District.Sparking fears of the bar in Yeoksam-dong, southern Seoul potentially becoming an infection cluster, the sickened employee is believed to have worked a nine-hour shift on March 27-28.She is believed to have contacted some 500 combined staff and customers during her shift and first showed symptoms of the virus the following day.Her roommate was also confirmed with COVID-19 earlier in the week, according to Gangnam District.Gangnam District said it is in the process of narrowing down staff and customers who were present at the venue with the infected employee.It added her records in late March were omitted in the epidemiological survey, as “the KCDC instructs surveys to include movements of a patient from a day before the first identified virus symptoms.”Yoon Hak’s agency claimed he had not visited the bar and briefly met the sickened employee outside the venue on March 26 before he was confirmed with COVID-19, refuting portrayals of the singer as a “virus spreader”.Health authorities and Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun have repeatedly urged young Koreans to hold back on visiting clubs and bars, as the packed spots are prone to virus transmission.With one in four entertainment businesses in the nightlife industry found to have violated government guidelines on social distancing between March 22 and April 5, authorities will focus their inspections on nightclubs and entertainment venues between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., according to the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters.By Kim Bo-gyung ( lisakim425@heraldcorp.comAs she deals with scrutiny as the leader of one of the most famous girl groups in the world, Jihyo said in an interview with Allure that she feels "the truest to myself" when playing video games.When 22-year-old K-pop star Yang Joon-il performs onstage, he slays. Sporting an oversize, printed jacket over a sleeveless black jumpsuit, he jumps in the air, dances on a chair, flips a fedora onto his head with a slight turn of hand, and seamlessly grabs a microphone.

"My love, Rebecca," he croons, sweat dripping from his asymmetrical hair to his chin, making its way to his bony clavicle. With his milky complexion and glowing skin, he looks beautiful – the epitome of a K-pop star.

But this is 1991, and South Korea has yet to evolve. This display of flamboyance, of outward beauty, is so offensive, audiences hiss and boo. Some even throw food at him. "He was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs," says an article by The Korea Times. His aesthetics and feminine mannerisms were so controversial, he claims, the government refused to renew his visa. Eventually, his career faded away.

Fast-forward almost three decades later, and it's almost unthinkable that Korean men like Yang would be treated with such vitriol. South Korea has since become the epicenter of beauty, and K-pop men are now synonymous with cosmetics. According to a 2017 finding, South Korea consumes $13 billion in cosmetics annually, Mintel reports. Under that figure, South Korean men are the number one male consumers of beauty per capita. Additionally, a 2018 Global Data report found that three-quarters of Korean men receive beauty treatments at least once per week.

Today's Korean man looks completely different than he did three decades ago. But how did South Korea progress so quickly? And how did Korean culture at large, once performatively hypermasculine, evolve into an arbiter of cosmetics equality?

It all has to do with South Korea’s obsession with competition. According to Edward Kang, who was a music producer in Korea and is now a Ph.D. student researching the intersection of pop culture and normativity at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, pressure to succeed also expands to one’s aesthetics. And it starts at a very young age.

"Similar to the way parents invest heavily in their children's educations, common high school or middle school graduation gifts from parents to their children are double eyelid surgeries," Kang says as an example. "Furthermore, as is now common knowledge, job recruitment sites in South Korea frequently require headshots on potential candidates' resumes."In America, 10-step skin-care routines have become the pinnacle representation of Korean beauty. Many of us assume our favorite glass-skinned K-pop stars go through the lengthy regimen, complete with toner, essence, and sheet-masking, to achieve their radiant, poreless complexions. According to the leader of girl group Twice, you may have the wrong idea about K-beauty. Extensive routines are not the norm. "I only use three steps," Jihyo tells Allure. (She doesn’t count her makeup removal process as part of her skin-care routine.) “There are some people who do the 10 steps, but I feel like too much product is unnecessary." Joy of Red Velvet may be one of those people.

While interviewing K-pop stars over the past three years, I’ve gotten in the habit of asking two specific questions. The first being "which member has the most extensive skin-care routine?" Then, I ask whoever it may be to share every single step of their routine. Now, I get to share all my findings in one place.

Unfortunately, K-pop stars are often forbidden to share their favorite skin-care products due to endorsement deals and contracts beyond my purview. I would love nothing more than to tell you the exact spray-on acidic cream Felix of Stray Kids swears by. (Don’t worry, I can reveal the $125 exfoliant Tiffany Young loves, though.) Luckily, steps are fair game, and I can give your some product recommendations based on what Allure editors in both the U.S. and Korea suggest.

Consider these idol skin-care routines as blueprints to follow for putting your own in order and figuring out what to add to your lineup. Before you even keep scrolling, I can tell you right now that double cleansing, which involves washing with an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser to remove every speck of makeup and impurities, is a given among both boy and girl group members. Some K-pop stars don’t even list it as a step because it’s implied that they must do it. Toner is also a major essential helping create a hydrating base for the rest of their products to better absorb into.

It’s 2004. My sister and I are in our hometown of Bangkok, Thailand. In the drawing room of my uncle’s house, we’re with our cousins learning a Bollywood dance choreography from our new favorite Bollywood film, Main Hoon Na. The film tells the story of two long-lost brothers who are separated during childhood and reunited as adults, and it’s the only thing we’ve watched all summer.

At the end of our three months back home, we’ll put on a variety show to demonstrate our favorite choreographies and perform skits we’ve seen in the movies. Our grandparents, close family friends, and extended family will be invited to enjoy our DIY production and for a moment, I’ll feel like I’ve regained a sense of home, something I thought I had lost upon our move to the United States. Then, my sister and I will return to suburban Ohio, two of the 5 Indian kids starting eighth grade.

Fast forward to 2019. In the middle of a shoebox apartment in New York City, my friends and I are learning the choreography to Korean pop group SEVENTEEN’s “Don’t Wanna Cry.” There’s no final performance where we’ll invite all our friends and family, but we’re still impressed with our ability to grasp the difficult moves, made all the more impressive by the furniture we’ve Tetris’d around to make space to dance. It’s an echo of my childhood, a routine that recalls those comforting summers back home. That celebration of dance and community around pop culture is part of a world I thought I lost as I grew up, but now in my 20s, I’m rediscovering the joy I felt as a kid at home through K-pop and K-dramas.

Beyond my own nostalgia, however, it’s interesting to think about Bollywood and Korean entertainment existing on some kind of shared plane. K-dramas and Indian films seem to follow similar tropes: dialogues that follow poetic cadences which don’t always translate properly into the English language, paired with a love story that seems wildly unrealistic but still hooks the viewer. Watching Netflix’s Crash Landing On You invoked the same feelings for me as when I first watched the Bollywood evergreen love story Veer-Zaara.

Meanwhile, the catchy songs released in both industries have complicated dance choreographies associated with them that become instantly recognizable. “Fancy” and “Sheila Ki Jawani” are both choreographies fans have learned and cemented in their minds. Further, the production of the aforementioned songs blends genre lines, even as it evokes a specific cultural reference point. As Suga from BTS once noted, K-pop is not necessarily a genre itself, but an amalgamation of styles of music, integrated with elements of clothing, choreography, and a grand presentation. Bollywood follows this same path, with songs that blend pop, hip-hop, and classical sounds presented with elaborate clothing and backdrops. The aesthetic is crucial to the sound.

Both the Hallyu wave (a surge of Korean media and pop culture expanding globally) and Bollywood wave have ferociously crashed onto western shores in recent decades. The former began around the ‘90s and early 2000s with K-pop groups like Seo Taiji and Boys and S.E.S. and has expanded through to today’s biggest names like BLACKPINK, BTS, and EXO. With Bollywood, the movement has included the Oscar-nominated film Slumdog Millionaire, and big name Bollywood actors such as Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone making their way to Hollywood.Popular K-pop girl group Girls' Alert have been forced to split after coronavirus took its toll on their management company's coffers.

The five-member band, who had hits with their debut single Dreamgirls in 2017 and We Got The Power in 2019, will disband after their managers were unable to continue paying their contracts.

In a statement, management company Roots Entertainment told gutted fans: "First, we would like to apologise.

"Due to the repercussions of COVID-19 and various other circumstances, our company's situation has worsened, and it is no longer possible for us to continue leading Girls' Alert.

"Therefore, Roots Entertainment has terminated the contracts of all of the members.

"We made this decision out of consideration for the members, so that each of them can freely pursue her own individual activities in the future, and we also want to cheer them on in the hopes that they will make fresh starts elsewhere.

"We hope that you will support and cheer on each of the members in the future.

"As for the activities that the group was already carrying out before this announcement, we will do our best to pull them off with the members that are available, so we hope that there will be no confusion."

The group - made up of members Jisung, Seul Bi, Saet Byeol, Goo Seul and Narin - were ranking in the fiercely competitive top 50 best K-pop girl bands in February.

Meanwhile, rival girl group Red Velvet's star singer Wendy has revealed she's recovering well after sustaining serious injuries at a K-pop concert on Christmas Day.

The singer fell from a platform more than two metres off the ground and sustained a severe fracture to her pelvis, as well as injuring her wrist and cheekbone.

She spent the next two months in hospital but was discharged in February to recover as an outpatient.K-Pop idols are fearless when it comes to experimenting with hair colour. The biggest stars have sampled all the colours of the rainbow, switching up their looks more frequently than most of us post to our Instagram feed.

As renowned hair designer Soonsiki, of Soonsiki Hair in Seoul, told Miss Vogue: “Natural looking hair colours such as brown and light brown were certainly the hair trend in South Korea a few years ago, but now it’s all about bleaching and adding fun colours as a way of expressing yourself. People aren’t afraid of colours anymore.”

We’re all aware of the love affair between K-Pop and fashion, but an idol’s hair is often an even bigger statement than their clothes. A drastic hair transformation is frequently used as a signal to fans that there is something exciting on the horizon: a tour, a new single, or a music video or album release. At times, a colour represents a group’s aesthetic related to their latest project, or an individual member’s personality. Take Blackpink’s Rosé for example, who mixed strands of pink with her naturally dark hair when she debuted and has since sported countless other shades of pink (as well as other colours), or BTS, who rocked bold, bright ’dos during their “Love Yourself” era, seen most notably in their equally vibrant music videos for the tracks “Idol” and “DNA”.

It’s not always about jumping from one bold colour to another, however. K-Pop idols go back to basics with natural looking shades from time to time, like those BTS have been sporting lately while promoting their latest album and Map Of The Soul tour – the concept for which is a deeply personal reflection on their seven-year journey as a band.

If you’ve been thinking about trying a bold new hair colour, being quarantined at home is the perfect opportunity to do it. For inspiration, we’ve compiled some of Miss Vogue’s favourite looks sported by K-Pop idols in recent years, along with tips from professional hairstylists on how to approach and maintain your new look.

Bleach London founder Alex Brownsell suggests the digital DIY salon the brand has set up in response to social distancing, which is perfect for home hair dye novices who want their hand held by an expert. “We’ll teach you everything you need to know so you feel confident to colour your hair in the comfort of your own bathroom,” she says. Customers can visit the website for a virtual consultation to chat through their desired look, after which Bleach will deliver the products required along with an access link to the Hair Party digital salon. “At the Hair Party, you’ll be joined by one of our Bleach colour experts on a video call to talk you through each step of dying your hair and the maintenance process,” Brownsell explains.

“Before dyeing your hair, have a think about whether it will suit your face shape, your skin tone and how that will affect your usual look, including your make-up and clothes,” Soonsiki told Miss Vogue. “Perhaps dyeing your hair will encourage you to try an entirely different look – and what better time to try than now?”

Brownsell, who also works as a session stylist on campaigns for the likes of Gucci, says: “Hair dye reacts differently to everyone’s hair, so it may not look like the picture on the box or a reference image you have. For example, vivid, deeper colours like fiery red are easier to achieve with naturally dark hair, as your hair will go a warmer, golden blonde after bleaching, which is the perfect base to make the red look really intense. Your final look will depend on your current colour and condition, hair porosity, length and thickness, as well as any previous colour treatments you’ve had. If you colour your hair often and are worried about over-processing, I’d definitely recommend doing a strand test at home first. If the hair condition is brittle or gummy after, take this time to give your hair a break and focus on treatment.”

“At the salon, first, we would bleach your hair to the lightest possible shade, then use a toner to neutralise any brassy undertones before applying your colour of choice,” says Brownsell. “Hair in good condition before bleaching is preferable, virgin hair [hair that has never been dyed] is ideal. Dyeing your hair at home is a similar process, however, the toning and dyeing happens at the same time. [But] all our instructions are detailed and doing your hair at home is easier than you think.”

Soonsiki says: “First, do a test patch on a strand of hair to make sure you’re not allergic to the products. It’s also best not to wash your hair before dyeing, as the oil on your scalp can be a protection later against the chemicals in the products. Apply Vaseline or lotion on the hairline and also your ears to protect your skin. After reading the instructions in the hair kit carefully, check that the ingredients are well mixed. Dye reacts faster to warmer temperatures, so remember to apply the dye to the tips of your hair first, and the roots [closer to the heat from your scalp] last.”

Hair designer Jongsu, from Seoul salon Jennyhouse, a favourite of K-Pop idols, says: “Check in on the colour of your hair after 15 to 20 minutes, and after leaving the dye in for the recommended time, wash out the dye with shampoo. When washing out the dye, make sure to emulsify evenly, otherwise the hair colour can be mottled.”

Pastel colours might seem like they only could only work for those with naturally fair hair, but Brownsell insists this isn’t always the case. “If your hair is naturally dark, it will be more difficult to go a very pale blonde, but not impossible! Use our Plex Bleach Kit to lift the hair while maintaining strong, healthy hair. After bleaching, you will need to tone to colour correct any brassy or yellow hues, otherwise the dye won’t show true to colour.”

How to maintain your new colour

“Try not to wash your hair too often, as it will encourage the colour in your hair to fade,” says Soonsiki. “Since your hair turns more alkaline after dyeing your hair, it’s best if you use shampoos exclusively for coloured and damaged hair. Wash your hair and particularly the scalp with warm or even cool water, as hot water opens hair cuticles that will release the colours. Letting your hair dry naturally is always best.”

Brownsell adds: “Use one of our Toning Kits or Toning Shampoo and Conditioner duos, depending on the colour you’re hoping to achieve. The shampoos can be used with every wash to keep the brightness of the colour. Our White Toning Kit is best for creating a clean, pale blonde. For a faded colour, use every other wash.”

How to keep your hair healthy

“To keep the hair nourished and healthy, using a treatment like the BLEACH London Reincarnation Mask is vital,” Brownsell told us. “Use the mask as a treatment or in place of a conditioner with every wash, and follow with our Hair Elixir on damp or dry hair for seriously soft hair.”

Soonsiki says: “I recommend my clients do a hair mask before washing hair, starting from the dry scalp all the way to the ends. Keep the hair mask on for 20 minutes and do this once or twice a week. Wash off the treatment with warm water, then dry with a towel. Apply the treatment again, wait 10 minutes and rinse with cold water.”

Meanwhile, Jongsu advises: “I like and use hair repairing product Ciment Thermique from Kérastase. It’s a thermo-protecting blow dry and heat-styling cream designed to protect weakened and damaged hair. If you have coloured hair and blow dry often, try this one to restore the strength and solidity of your hair.”

“You’ll need an old T-shirt (so you don’t stain your nice clothes), a shower cap (or cling film) to wear during the dyeing process, and a few mirrors, so you can see the back of your head, or ask someone at home to help you if you can,” says Brownsell. “Every kit comes with gloves, brushes and tubs, but you can also find these online if you are in need of more. Have all the products laid out and ready to go, and use the timer on your phone to keep track of time.”

“Protein is key to keeping your hair healthy, and hair treatments can even be made at home – if you don’t mind the smell,” Soonsiki says. “You’ll need one egg yolk, three tablespoons of mayonnaise, and one tablespoon of honey, plus a hair wrap or cap, gloves, and a brush or a comb. Mix all the ingredients together until the mixture is viscous. Apply water to your hair then add the home-made treatment to the ends of your hair with your brush or comb. Wrap your hair in the hair cap and leave for 20 to 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water.”

What about your roots?

“If you want to bleach your roots at home, it’s important to wait until the root regrowth is approximately 2.5cm long (usually about six to eight weeks growth),” says Brownsell. “People think that leaving their hair longer between bleaching will protect it, but it’s actually the opposite. You damage hair less by only ever bleaching the first few centimetres, as the heat from your scalp helps to speed up the lifting process – meaning you can leave the bleach on for less time.”

It can sometimes be confused with kid’s pop (no offense Kidz Bop), killer pop or any other word that starts with the letter K. If you’re caught up on the music industry, you’ve heard of K-pop, or popular K-pop groups BTS and Blackpink. Within the last year, K-pop artists have appeared on American television programs such as Ellen, Saturday Night Live and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

K-pop has only entered the mainstream American music scene in the past few years.As a fan of K-pop artists for the past 7 years, I have had the opportunity to see this East to West cultural exchange unfold.

K-pop artists offer more content than albums and music videos. Online concerts, reality shows, livestreams and more have all been produced for fans to watch voraciously. This seemingly endless content is even more appealing in the time of COVID-19, so I have compiled a list of some K-pop activities you can try to forget about the outside world.

If you like Keeping Up with the Kardashians

Try watching a K-pop group reality show. One of the most popular options is Run BTS! which consists of 100 30-minute episodes. The show centers around the seven members of BTS competing against each other and completing various challenges. These creative episodes are sure to be laughter-inducing. Many other groups have also participated in shows similar to this, and most are available for free online with subtitles. Run BTS! and various other reality shows and livestreams can be streamed on the V LIVE app, a platform similar to Twitch.

If you like The Voice or American Idol

Try watching a K-pop competition show. One popular series is Produce 101, where K-pop trainees compete to capture the hearts of viewers who vote to decide who will be in the final group that will make a debut. While the Produce 101 series has recently been surrounded by a controversy of vote manipulation, it is still a show that allows viewers to form an emotional bond with contestants. Other competition shows like Masked Singer (which originated in Korea) and Queendom, an all-female competition, are sure to keep your attention for hours.

If you like to dance

Invest some time in learning a K-pop dance. Dances range in their levels of difficulty, and are a great opportunity to exercise while being cooped up inside.They also encompass a wide variety of dance styles, from contemporary to hip-hop. The YouTube channel Ellen and Brian, features K-pop dance covers and in-depth dance tutorials for popular K-pop songs.

If you like watching concerts

Many K-pop artists are livestreaming concerts for fans who are stuck at home. On April 17 and 18 beginning each day at 11 p.m. Eastern time, BTS is livestreaming eight of their previous concerts on the YouTube channel BANGTANTV for fans to watch for free. Korean music shows are also still allowing artists to perform, without an audience, and most of these performances are available on YouTube.

Don’t be surprised if you watch one of these videos , and then five hours later you end up wondering where the time has gone and when you can go see these incredible artists in concert in person.What K-Pop stars are up to during coronavirus lockdown

Artists are promoting social distancing and keeping active during the COVID-19 pandemicSo you've gotten into K-pop. Yay! It's fun, right? You may have even worked your way around the language barrier by reading fan translations and marveling at the overachievers who’re learning to read and write Hangul. But when stans start throwing around words like idol, fighting, and all-kill, are you left scratching your head in confusion? What's with all the ㅋㅋ comments after BTS's Jin posts a dad joke? And why are people buying bongs for upcoming concerts? That’s not even legal. (Or is it?) We're here to help you out with some K-pop words and phrases that may not be in your vocabulary… yet.

A somewhat sinister phrase for an awesome achievement. An all-kill refers to a song hitting the No. 1 spot on all of the Korean music charts.

This English portmanteau is made from baby-face and glamorous (read: sexy!) body. Though most often used to describe female idols (Bae Suzy), male cutie pies like 2PM’s Nichkhun also fall into this category.

Favorite member. (A bias wrecker is your fave's bandmate who is thisclose to swaying your allegiance.)

Noooooooo! We’re not talking about the device used for smoking pot. In K-pop parlance, bong refers to light sticks. TWICE fans' lights are called the Candy Bong, but Big Bang’s alliteration game is strong with their Bang Bong.

You don’t have to wait years (or decades) for a comeback in K-pop! Each new release is a comeback, complete with teasers, music videos, and often detailed concepts. And though groups can have more than one comeback a year, each is treated like a long-awaited surprise. Fans love it, and it’s honestly one of the most fun treats for K-pop stans.

When you hear your bias say this, don’t worry. They’re not about to throw down. Koreans use this word to show encouragement and support. The English equivalent would be, “Good luck,” but where’s the fun in saying that?

Maknae means the youngest. Golden maknae refers to the youngest member of the group who is effortlessly good at everything.

A perk for fans who are willing to shell out extra money, hi-touch is K-pop vernacular for a high five. After concerts, fans will get the chance to say a few words as they quickly high-five the group.

Once upon a time, Korean singers were called gasu. Today they’re idols.

Pronounced "kieuk," this is the Korean equivalent of "ha ha."

K-pop concerts usually run about two to two and a half hours with no opening acts. When they’re not singing and dancing, idols pepper their shows with ments — little speeches to show their appreciation. It’s something to look forward to because while the idols will joke around and make the crowd roar with laughter, they also share touching stories that make many fans weep.

Overly invested fans who cross the line and are more akin to stalkers. We’re not talking about asking for an autograph at a fan meeting, but repeatedly invading an idol’s privacy. A German sasaeng bought business class seats on the same flight as TWICE and attempted to give Nayeon a handful of letters he had written.

The best-looking in a group full of ridiculously good-looking members.

Slated for launch on April 29, new episodes of the series will be aired every Wednesday on the group's official YouTube channel. (gis/kes)The world has become enamored with K-pop. You may not understand the lyrics, but the flower petals sprinkled atop a star’s radiant cheekbones and their grapefruit-pink hair create a special fantasy. With this project, we wanted to celebrate and explore the beauty of K-pop. Although this was in the works long before COVID-19 — and subsequent anti-Asian racism — started to spread, sharing this now feels more necessary than ever. Both music and beauty are universal, and both can help us feel connected, inspired, and soothed during this unprecedented time. Through this series, we hope you better understand (and appreciate) the stunning intricacies of one of our favorite South Korean exports.Dropping a new album Monday, Apink marks its 10th year in the K-pop scene, becoming a rare K-pop idol girl band to have a decade-long career.

 The six-piece band's ninth EP, "Look," is scheduled to hit major online music stores Monday evening, the first release from the group since the EP, "PERCENT," dropped in January 2019.

 The new album is led by the single, "Dumhdurum," and carries a total of seven tracks, oriented toward the subject, "I." The lead single is an addictive dance number and Apink's latest collaboration with songwriting duo Black Eyed Pilseung, as well as Jeon Gun, known for producing a series of hit songs for A-list girl bands. 

 The album's main message, "I love my own self as it is and I will live as I choose," is a declaration of confidence possible only from such a long-reigning band as Apink.

 "With the new album, we want to remind (fans) of who Apink is. At the same time, we also wanna hear from fans (through the album) that 'That's indeed Apink,'" member Oh Ha-young said in a written Q&A, released by Play M Entertainment. 

 Member Yoon Bo-mi stressed that the latest album effectively sheds light on the character and the forte of each and every band member. 

 "As indicated by the album title, 'Look,' (fans) may be able to look at and find the charm of every member," she said.

 In January, the band celebrated its ninth anniversary since its debut in 2011 and is now on course to count its 10th year, solidifying its presence as one of the longest-running idol girl band still active in the K-pop scene. 

 "(Despite the long career) we are still very excited and nervous ahead of a new album release," team leader Park Cho-rong said.

 "We began our 10th year this year, but our craving and thirst for a (good) album is just the same as when we debuted," the leader noted. 

 Park wrote the lyrics for "I Love Your Every Moment," one of the new album's two songs dedicated to fans. 

 The track list of "Look" also includes "By Myself" and "Love is Blind" in addition to the lead single "Dumhdurum," which depicts being unfazed by being abandoned by a lover. 

 "Apink has grown up and its music has also transformed and developed with us as time went by. Going forward, we want to continue to grow and illuminate our own color," member Jung Eun-ji said. (Yonhap)G-Dragon of Big Bang is rumoured to be one of the K-pop artists invited to perform in a Chinese version of the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert for coronavirus victims.K-pop artists Lee Gi-kwang and BOL4 have strongly denied allegations they took part in manipulating music charts.



Lee's agency Around US Entertainment told the Hankook Ilbo on Wednesday that the artist has nothing to do with the allegations. "We will be responding to this spread of false rumors with legal procedures," it said. 



BOL4's agency Shofar Music said: "We were surprised that BOL4's name was mentioned... we are reviewing to take legal action."



Politician Kim Geun-tae of the People's Party raised the allegations at a press conference Wednesday, naming a list of artists over a chart-ranking scheme. 



He said IT marketing company Creativer illegally acquired random user accounts of streaming sites and used them to manipulate the charts by increasing the streaming numbers of a song. 



"The artists I've confirmed that have worked with this company are Ko Seung-hyung, girl groups GWSN and Badkiz, BOL4, Song Ha-yea, YoungTak, YOYOMI, Sohyang, Ali and Lee Gi-kwang," he said. 



Artists who were mentioned have been releasing statements denying Kim's claim, including GWSN, Ko, YoungTak and Song.The 27-year-old songstress, whose real name is Lee Ji-eun, is one of K-pop's biggest female stars, boasting a strong and steady performance on streaming services and sell-out concerts since her 2008 debut. The new song marks her first new music since her fifth EP, "Love Poem," released last November.DUBAI: Korean musical group B.I.G has released a coronavirus-inspired song — and it’s in Arabic. Entitled “Corona Song,” the K-pop band’s new tune is a 35-second excerpt that aims to empower and encourage those struggling with the pandemic.

In addition to B.I.G – an acronym Boys in Groove – GH Entertainment’s other artists participated in the project and sang in six different languages.

Girl group 3YE released English and Spanish versions, while solo artists Soya, Kang Tae-kang and Louis Choi sang in Japanese, Chinese and German, respectively.

It’s not the first time that the Korean boy band has released music in the Arabic language for their legion of Middle Eastern fans. Their covers of Arabic songs, such as Emirati singer Hussain Al-Jassmi’s “Boshret Kheir” for their Global Cover Project, instantly went viral.

Ahead of the band’s Abu Dhabi concert last November, the group released “Illusion,” a track in two languages, Korean and Arabic. The move marked the first K-pop genre song by any group sung entirely in Arabic.Aside from being known for its spicy food and popular dramas, South Korea is also recognized as the land of gamers. Many of the pro players we know and love today hail from Korea including League of Legends‘ Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok, Overwatch‘s Bang “JJonak” Sung-hyeon, and Dota 2‘s Kim “QO” Sun Yeob.

So it should be no surprise that many Korean idols and K-pop groups are also gamers, and many even stream their games.

Here are five K-pop idols you never knew were also game streamers:

Yang Hong-seok, the lead vocalist of Cube Entertainment’s nine-member group Pentagon, has been known to enjoy first-person shooters, and is particularly fond of Korean title, Sudden Attack, which is very similar to CS:GO.

At one point, Hongseok held a virtual fan-sign event inside the game and even sang their group’s latest song Dr. Bebe for his team.

Hongseok and the rest of Pentagon go live on their official YouTube channel, PENTAGON 펜타곤.

Aside from her insane rapping skills, Jo “Miryo” Mi-hye is also amazing in games. She started streaming last year, moving from Twitch, AfreecaTV, and now YouTube. Miryo plays a variety of popular online games, such as League of Legends, PUBG, Dead by Daylight, and Overwatch.

As a part of the first-generation girl group Brown Eyed Girls, she sometimes teams up with the main dancer and her good friend Son Ga-In for a couple of Overwatch matches.

Miryo’s love for the game has even inspired her to put on make-up similar to Ashe from Overwatch.

Only members of her channel have access to her full live streams, but Miryo posts snippets of her gaming sessions on her YouTube channel.

They are one and united in the performing stage, as well as in the gaming stage.

Recently South Korean–Chinese boy band EXO made it to the streaming spotlight as part of SM Entertainment’s ongoing series Super Idol League. For its season 7, the group’s main rapper Park Chan-yeol played Honor of Kings (Wangzhe Rongyao), China’s version of Arena of Valor.

Other EXO members also appeared on the show, including Byun Baek-hyun and Oh Se-hun playing League of Legends and PUBG.

Super Idol League highlights SM’s talents while playing video games. Girls Generation members Lee “Sunny” Soon-gyu and Kim Tae-yeon were previously in the show where they streamed PUBG. Super Junior’s vocalist Kim Hee-chul has also appeared in past episodes.

EXO-Ls can catch them live on the Chinese site Huya.

This young Japanese idol has dominated girl groups HKT48, AKB48, and now IZ*ONE and the gaming scene. Her free time practically goes to playing video games, as she owns a gaming PC, a PlayStation 4, and even a Nintendo Switch.

Miyawaki Sakura is not just about the looks, she’s also pretty good at her games as seen in this clip of her playing battle royale game Fortnite.

Highlights of her games can be viewed on her YouTube channel, ちゃんねる宮脇咲良.

Our Akali in real-life, (G)-I-DLE’s leader and main rapper Jeon Soyeon went on a live broadcast playing League of Legends while showing off various K/DA merchandise only a Summoner could envy.

She even played as Akali in the mid-lane, wearing the iconic K/DA skin.

Soyeon stole everyone’s hearts during the 2018 League of Legends World Championship (Worlds). Together with the group’s main vocalist Cho Mi Yeon, they brought LoL champions Akali and Ahri to life by performing K/DA’s POP/STARS.

She instantly became a fan-favorite after her stellar performance, and on the following year, made an appearance during the 2019 Worlds opening ceremony this time as part of the group True Damage.

Neverlands and Summoners alike can catch Soyeon’s LoL game on (G)-I-DLE’s YouTube channel.

READ MORE: K-pop idols who are also hardcore gamersWhen Eric Nam got off the bus in Los Angeles, for the first of his last two U.S. stops on his “Before We Begin” tour, he had no idea the concert would be postponed mere hours before showtime. Just two days prior, he had successfully performed in San Francisco, and after playing over 30 shows across the States —the most extensive Stateside tour to date for an artist in the K-pop ecosystem — the Korean-American singer was excited to play LA. He had labels coming in to see him, singer-songwriter friends, and people who had helped him throughout his career. But on the day of the show, the Los Angeles mayor ordered the postponement or cancellation of all non-essential gatherings of 50 or more participants in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Through social media, Nam announced the postponement of his last two LA shows for September. He later cancelled the Latin American leg of the tour and held off on announcing other regions. 



Instead of gearing up for his show in Mexico City as originally scheduled, Nam talked to i-D over the phone as he was practicing self-isolation in an AirBnB in Los Angeles. “It felt like we never got closure on anything, so it feels kind of weird,” the 31-year-old said with a laugh about the sudden halt of the tour. “But that’s life, and obviously health is more important.”

The Atlanta native embarked on the “Before We Begin” tour back in January after releasing his first all-English language EP by the same name last fall. The album was a melodic pop collection of love songs co-written by Nam based on his life experiences. The lyrical content — from celebrating a break-up on “Congratulations” to two lovers lusting over each other on “You’re Sexy I’m Sexy” to not letting a relationship end on “Love Die Young” — was more forward and mature than what his music in Korean has been, showing off a new side that diverged from the prim image K-pop artists typically portray. Musically, the album breezes through R&B tinged tracks to ballads to ambient pop. Before We Begin was intended as a feeler album that bridged Nam’s glossier pop material as a K-pop star to the pop artist he wants to be as he moves forward in his career, and the tour was the manifestation of this transition.

“I think overall this tour for me was a very meaningful experience and I hope I can look back one day and say that it was a very pivotal moment, where everything that I did reflects in ways that really builds my career as a musician in the future,” Nam said.

After building a successful career as a singer, interviewer, and TV show host in South Korea, Nam is finally trying to find his way back home, and Before We Begin was his first step in that direction. “My entire mission of being in Korea was to be able to come back to the States and do stuff in the States,” he explained. “Because back when I started, there was no Asian face in music. There was no Asian face really on TV either. So my idea was, ‘Let’s go Korea, get big there, and then reverse engineer it so they can’t ignore us when we’re back.”

To be an “Asian face” in music in America, the Atlantan gave up a lucrative job in the finance world to go to South Korea to compete on an American Idol-like TV show and chase his musical dreams. And though he didn’t win, he signed with an entertainment label and began a career as a soloist. Throughout the years, Nam positioned himself as one of the most prominent K-pop artists for international audiences, given he was a fluent English speaker and his overall approachable demeanor.

Over the years, Nam crafted an experimental discography that ranged from ballads to EDM-pop bangers. He also collaborated with big names in both the K-pop world and the global music market, like “Spring Love” with Red Velvet’s Wendy, “Cave Me In” with Tablo from Epik High and Gallant, and “Body” with Timbaland.

But after spending 10 years in Korea, Nam now wants to build his name in the States, and he feels that this is the perfect time culture-wise. “When we first started and we were trying to push the envelope of being like an Asian face in music five, six years ago, people were like, ‘No, nobody thinks Asian people are cool. Nobody thinks Asian people are sexy. We don’t need this in music,’” he recounted. “Now it has changed where labels are saying, ‘Ok, let’s actually talk. Clearly we’ve been late to the game.’ And everybody is still late to the game because my point is still this: Where do you see an Asian face in Asian-American music? Who is there? There’s barely anyone.”

Though there’s still a long way to go, Asian representation in music has become more visible in recent years. Joji and Rich Brian, together with the rest of the 88rising artists, have been spearheading an Asian movement in music on a global, mainstream scale. Different K-pop groups have been breaking all kinds of records, which in turn have caught the attention of American labels. But as Nam pointed out, Rich Brian is from Indonesia and Joji from Japan. In the case of K-pop groups, though the nationalities and backgrounds of individual members can vary, they’re still developed in South Korea. The last couple of years have seen groups like NCT 127, Monsta X, Blackpink, TXT, and more sign global distribution deals with different American record companies, a trend that doesn’t seem to be stopping soon.

In a moment of candidness, Nam expressed his frustration with record labels flocking towards K-pop just for its streaming and sales numbers. “That’s what I don’t like about this right now,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited that people are trying to do this with groups. But to be very blunt, what it looks like to me is like a numbers grab. Like, ‘Oh these people have a couple million followers and they get these views, let’s just sign them.’”

Despite K-pop’s growing popularity, it is still othered in the U.S. by the media and public, and Nam thinks that ultimately hinders his career. The singer added that what he wants to see happen is to find a label partner who will put their A&R and marketing dollars behind him because they share his vision and stand for diversity and inclusion of Asian American artists —not just because he comes from the K-pop world. “I don’t want to be an import. I am an American,” he said, referencing not wanting to be boxed as a K-pop artist forever. “If I could choose, I would like to just say [I’m a] pop artist, because I would like to be seen and I would like to be treated in the same way as any other pop white, black, American artist is treated here. And I want my music and my performance and my personality to be taken and treated the same way.”

COVID-19 may have stalled Nam’s plans for an American takeover, but he’s still working on new music, content-related projects with tech companies, and his various podcasts. He even launched a new podcast two weeks ago that plays with the idea that everyone’s at home with nothing to do called “Commit or Quit,” where him and his brothers, Eddie and Brian, watch the first two episodes of Korean dramas and movies and decide if they want to keep watching while contextualizing the cultural references for foreign audiences.

At the beginning of the call, Nam said he was feeling overwhelmed by the entire situation, but by the end, he was looking at the silver lining. “I feel like people have a little bit more time on their hands, so they’ve been able to get in touch with people they haven’t been in touch with before. And we start to have conversations of what it means to be a part of a bigger community, of a global community. And how we tackle issues together. And while we’re not all the same or we’re not all alike, it’s important that we’re able to have these meaningful conversations, Nam said. He called this a time for people to take a step back and reevaluate what’s important. “Not trying to make light of any horrible situation, but I think that if there’s something that we can look to and learn from or like say ‘Ok, this is still important,’ those type of takeaways I think that are good right now in this moment.”With an unbridled spirit, exceptional sound and dedication to music, Stella Jang is the kind of a musician who immediately attracts attention. 



Reflecting her down-to-earth personality, her music used to revolve around ordinary topics people could easily relate to. Her lyrics were remarkably outspoken, creative and witty, so they almost felt like a diary written by the singer-songwriter herself. 



Having turned 30 this year in Korean age, Jang said that her music, however, inevitably had to change over time. 



“I’d thought my early 20s were dynamic enough, but now I understand why there’s a saying that ‘youth is wasted on the young.’ I think late 20s is the age where you really learn about things,” said Jang during a recent interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. 



The biggest change in herself was developing a habit of viewing things from various aspects. It also came along with a deepened understanding of dynamics of human relations, which she’s struggled with for quite a long time. 



“Now I can’t easily make songs like my debut single ‘Dumped Yesterday,’ a song that flatly criticizes a boy for dumping a girl. In hindsight, I’m thinking, ‘Maybe there was a reason for getting dumped,’ and ‘Do I have the right to blame him? I’m not a saint either,’” she said. 



“So yeah, now it’s not easy to channel my own, one-sided opinion through music, unless I have a very full understanding of the circumstances.” 



So it’s perhaps no surprise that her recently released first full-length album “Stella 1” sounds more toned-down than usual. One of the double lead tracks “Reality Blue” is about feeling blue after returning to reality from a vacation, while “Villain” relays the message of how every person has a demon and an angel in them. The 12-track album also features English songs like “Go Your Way,” “Bourgeois Emotion,” “You Don’t Shine Anymore” and “Forgive Forget.”



Her road into K-pop wasn’t smooth. Unlike many other K-pop wannabes who start out as trainees from young age, Jang flew to Paris at the age of 12 to study abroad. After graduating from Grandes Ecoles, a prestigious higher level institution in France, she returned to Korea to seek a job. But her inner voice kept telling her to pursue her love for music. 



“While I’ve been depicted as a highly educated person on media and such descriptions have been always followed me around, studying has never really been my nature. My parents worried about me when I told them that I would do music as my career, and I wanted to quickly prove them that I could succeed,” she said. 



But harsh reality awaited her. She released her first single “Dumped Yesterday” in 2014, but she had very few listeners who recognized her, Jang recalled, and after years in the shadows, she was on the verge of giving up. Then in 2017 she got to feature on “Problematic Men,” a famous TV show that invites guests known for being intellectual. Her world has been in upheaval ever since. 



“Appearing on that show opened the floodgates; it was the tipping point in my musical life,” she said, emphasizing how everything has to be aligned for someone to be successful in the music industry and promoting oneself was one of the most important steps. 



She has since appeared on several more TV programs and music shows and achieved a stable fandom and sell-out concerts. 



But she revealed that she was still adapting to the cold reality of the K-pop industry and dealing with different kinds of relationships in it. 



“I guess this is the price we should pay for being alive,” said Jang with a shrug. 



Jang jokingly says that her straightforward personality might not fit into showbiz, but the industry seems to recognize her prowess, as she recently got to work on BTS’ album. 



Jang co-wrote K-pop juggernaut’s “Friends,” a song about friendship between bandmates V and Jimin from the group’s latest album “Map of the Soul: 7.”



“It was such an honor and pleasure to work on the song. When I first got a call from Big Hit Entertainment, I didn’t expect that it would be about BTS at all. When they politely said, ‘There’s an act called BTS in our company, and we would like to ask for your songwriting,’ I was like, ‘What? Are you kidding? Of course everybody knows BTS!’” said Jang with a laugh.



She went onto share that she had to learn about the close relationship between V and Jimin from her friend, who was a passionate fan of BTS. 



She also collaborated with singer-songwriter Paul Kim. 



“Colors,” one of her early hits, became viral on TikTok as global users, even including famous Hollywood actress Jessica Alba, made videos with the song. 



Jang’s love for music was palpable throughout the conversation. When she elaborated on why she adored songs by British rock band Oasis and ardently explained the songs’ musical structures, her eyes twinkled. 



But when asked about her next musical goal, the singer seemed to approach music in a more down-to-earth way. 



“Maybe I’ve become more cynical and my feelings for music may not be as pure as in the past. But I think pursuing way too high goals can make you miserable, as it can’t be done with my own will,” she said. 



She calmly added with a smile, “Maybe it’s okay not to have a dream.” 



By Hong Dam-young (lotus@heraldcorp.com)Jihyo of Twice appears on its May 2020 print edition, while JB of GOT7 stars in a special digital cover.

On Monday, Allure dropped not one, but two covers — one print, one digital — for its May 2020 "Best of Global Beauty" issue (the publication's first), which focuses mainly on South Korea and, specifically, the impact K-pop has had beyond music.

Jihyo of the girl group Twice fronts Allure's May 2020 print edition (pictured above), and GOT7's JB appears on a special digital cover (below). They're part of a larger package that includes a digital hub, an editorial collaboration with Allure Korea, artwork from Seoul-based creators and an Allure Beauty Box dedicated to K-beauty.

In her editor's letter, Allure editor-in-chief Michelle Lee addressed the internal back-and-forth around releasing the publications' "Best of Global Beauty" issue amid a worldwide pandemic. "Suddenly we were faced with so many questions," she wrote. "First and foremost: How do we keep the staff, ourselves, and our loved ones safe? After that not-so-easily-solved problem, there were more: How do we share a global beauty issue in the midst of a global health crisis? How do we celebrate K-pop and Korean beauty on our cover while being sensitive to the widespread concerns about the effects of this pandemic?"

Lee continued: "I'll be honest — we didn't know exactly how to respond. These are truly uncharted waters, and reactions around the world have run the gamut, from hysteria to apathy. Some people have given in to their worst impulses. Panic and paranoia — and a disturbing wave of anti-Asian racism — have reared their ugly heads... Ultimately, this crisis has reminded us just how interconnected we truly are. It has been a reminder and a necessary wake-up call that decisions we make — as countries, as families, as individuals — can greatly impact others."

You can find Allure's "Beauty of K-Pop" digital hub on its website.

Sign up for our daily newsletter and get us directly in your inbox.As quarantine and social-distancing measures continue around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone's suddenly on the lookout for a new hobby to distract themselves with. If you're not one of the millions of fans already obsessed, might we suggest getting into the world's most popular music scene: K-pop.

Thanks to acts like BTS and BLACKPINK, Korean artists have made major inroads into international markets of late, and gained notice from the likes of Lady Gaga, Lil Nas X and Nicki Minaj. If you've peeped a K-pop video pop across your YouTube feed and want to know more, we're here to help you catch up. There's a lot to learn about K-pop — it's the perfect quarantine pop culture deep dive.

While South Korea had no doubt been creating "pop" music for years, the genre-bending world of K-pop we know today originated in the early '90s. A trio named Seo Taiji and Boys became sensations in Korea with their never-before-attempted blend of music influenced by American trends that brought the sounds of hip-hop and New Jack Swing into the country with the song "I Know." The group's influence has been recognized by K-pop artists throughout the years, as when BTS paid tribute to Seo Taiji with a cover of the track "Come Back Home."

The trio lead the way for attractive boy bands, girl groups and other idols who could deliver a range of sounds, dance and other skills to become new-age, hybrid pop stars. From the late '90s onwards, record labels in Korea have become entertainment hubs for molding and delivering generations of acts that look to continuously blaze new paths for greater future takeover in the global music scene.

King BTS: At this point, you know BTS. Their dominance in the Korean-music scene is truly unlike anything we've seen before. With the February release of their career-defining Map of the Soul: 7 album, the band not only topped charts across the world (earning the year's biggest sales week for an album in America to date) but broke records in Korea (no Korean album has ever sold as many physical copies as Map of the Soul: 7 has...ever).

A Colorful Soloist: K-pop isn't only just about the groups. Solo superstar Kang Daniel has Korea's fourth-best-selling album to date. The singer-songwriter also gained initial fame through a singing-competition reality show and broke out on his own last year with a massive fanbase supporting him. His Cyan album and its single "2U" delivers the refreshing kind of synth-pop goodness we all need right now.

Of Course, BTS: BTS is leading the YouTube game this year with two music videos to their single "On" boasting huge numbers. First up, the "Kinetic Manifesto Film : Come Prima" version of "On" showcased the song's powerful choreography (with more than 160 million views at press time) and was followed up with one of the year's most cinematic storylines and visuals in its official music video (with more than 120 million views so far).

Don't Sleep on EVERGLOW: After just over a year in the industry, EVERGLOW has become a favorite of international fans, landing their "Dun Dun" music video more than 110 million clicks so far. While EVERGLOW is waiting for a larger breakout moment in Korea, you'd be wise to be up to date on these girls before they blow up bigtime.

Lisa Makes Us Hungry for More BLACKPINK: While we're getting desperate waiting for new music from BLACKPINK ("Kill This Love" was PAPER's No. 1 favorite song last year), the group's standout dancer has been blessing us with content on her YouTube channel. Most recently, the star delivered a stunning dance video that showcases not only her mind-boggling flexibility, but also her ability for incredible improvisation. Get hypnotized to her routine to QUIN and 6LACK's "Mushroom Chocolate":

Thrusting Into ATEEZ: Rising boy band ATEEZ has become one to watch since their debut in late 2018 and their latest single "Answer" continues to make good on their promise for K-pop greatness. While the track showcases some of the group's best harmony and vocal work to date, their choreographed hip thrusts on the chorus are almost as important.

2020's New Acts to Know On average, there was a new K-pop act debuting every two days or so last year. Even in just four months in, 2020 has brought some impressive groups that are snatching supporters quickly. Become fans of them now and you'll be able to brag you were into them before everyone else.

But perhaps the easiest thing you can do is just be a fan. Whether it's buying an album, saying hi to them on Twitter or watching their video on YouTube, supporting your favorite artists is more crucial than ever when it's more difficult for artists to promote in the time of coronavirus. Especially in such a fast-paced industry like K-pop, letting your favorites know you're there for them is so important.SINGAPORE - The South Korean embassy in Singapore is hoping to lift Singaporeans' spirits with K-pop.

Everybody is already aware of the impact of the lengthy Korean skincare routine that ensures smooth, glassy and flawless skin. K Pop stars are all known for their phenomenal skin, even-toned complexion and how plump and glassy their skin looks. 

When it comes to ti IU or Lee Ji-eun, popular South Korean singer-songwriter and actress who is known for her enviable voice, acting skills and of course, skin, keeping her skin healthy is quite simple. She starlet who rose to fame at the tender age of 15 with her album Lost and Found, is known to stick to the basics for her skin!

So what is it IU swears by?

Sunscreen 

Somehow, IU's skin always looks flawless, hydrated and glossy. This comes from the fact that the diva doesn't step foot outside without slathering on loads of moisturiser and sunscreen to protect her skin from the harsh sun and free radicals. She also ensures she is always hydrated by always sipping on water.

Toner 

Remember the three-step rule: cleansing, toning and moisturising? IU believes that toner does it all - evens the skin tone, soothes inflammation, closes up pores, hydrates skin and most importantly leaves it feeling and looking healthy. Her skincare routine is incomplete without toner in it.

Facial Oil 

The latest beauty fad is sticking on for a reason - it works! All IU's skin needs is just two drops of facial oil to do the trick. 

Pro tip: to shorten her routine, the diva is known to mix up her moisturising and hydrating toner with facial oil on a cotton pad and patting this glorious mixture on her face for around five minutes so it can take in all the goodness from this concoction.

And voila, her secret to smooth, clear and flawless skin is revealed! Are you going to add these to your skincare routine as well? Let us know in the comment section below.

Your comment has been submitted to the moderation queueStarship Entertainment have unleashed new boy group Cravity, their first new boy group in five years.

Their debut single Break All The Rules is a retro track that wouldn’t have felt out of place five or so years ago, but its stomping beat is memorable and catchy and a solid first song.

Break The Rules is the title track from their album which has the lengthy title CRAVITY “HIDE OUT : REMEMBER WHO WE ARE”.

Labelmates with MONSTA X and Cosmic Girls, Cravity is in very good company. In fact, rapper Joohoney from MONSTA X produced a song for their album.

With nine members in total, we understand if you need to take your time picking your favourite.

Until then, here’s a helpful guide to the newest boy group on the block.

What on earth does Cravity mean?

The most popular theory is that Cravity is a combination of the words ‘creativity’ and ‘gravity’, and also stands for Centre of Gravity.

As they’re still so new, Cravity’s official fandom name (like ARMY are to BTS and ONCE are to TWICE) is yet to be decided.

How did Cravity come about?

Cravity have been in the making since February this year, after Starship confirmed they were gearing up to launch a brand new nine-member boy group.

The decision was likely triggered by the disbandment of boy group X1 which was formed on the Mnet survival show Produce X 101 in July 2019.

Starship trainees Hyeoungjun and Minhee were members of the group while Wonjin competed in the series.

In the wake of allegations that X1’s line-up was pre-decided before the public votes were even counted, the agencies involved couldn’t reach an agreement and the group split.

Now Starship Entertainment is giving their trainees another shot at stardom.

Who are the members of Cravity?

Cravity’s nine members are: Serim, Allen, Jungmo, Woobin, Wonjin, Minhee, Hyeongjun, Taeyoung and Seongmin.

Here they are.

Yep. Their video for Break All The Rules is right here.

MORE : Top Gear’s Freddie Flintoff secretly welcomes fourth child – and baby’s name pays special homage to his hometown

MORE : Strictly Come Dancing’s AJ Pritchard remains coy over I’m A Celebrity 2020 rumoursAfter fans celebrated the legal victory for Wonho regarding past allegations last month, they can now cheer for the former Monsta X member as he moves forward with his K-pop career.

On Thursday, April 9, Wonho and Korean record label Highline Entertainment announced that they had signed an exclusive contract for the 27-year-old as a solo artist. The singer-songwriter-producer will move forward as his label promises “full support.”

In a statement shared via Highline Entertainment, Wonho said “I deeply regret the foolish and rash behavior of the past...I really appreciate the fans for giving me this opportunity, and I will do my best to repay your support.”

Highline added that they “will give full support to Wonho to be a solo artist in the future.”

Highline Entertainment is a subsidiary label of Starship Entertainment—the home to K-pop groups including Monsta X, WJSN and Cravity—and houses viral EDM star DJ Soda (who boasts nearly four million Instagram follower) and producer/singer-songwriter dress (who has worked with top K-pop acts like Baekhyun and Zico).

While fans have waited for months for news about Wonho, they can now rest easy for the return of a star whose career was sidetracked by unproven rumors. While negative allegations of any sorts tend to spell the demise of any K-pop career in the notoriously harsh industry, Wonho signing with a subsidiary of his label marks a major step towards not discarding artists whose character take a slight turn but instead seeing out the commitment towards one another til the end.

Most recently, fans had shown their support for the artist by sending the 2017 song “From Zero,” a special track co-written and producer by Wonho, to No. 1 on Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart to help prove his continuing viability and commercial appeal as an artist, songwriter and producer. No doubt these acts—along with online and street protests, and other projects for Wonho—helped the star get back on track and very possibly change the course of his future. As well, being back in his label home allows Wonho to have similar staff who know his preferences and goals instead of restarting completely anew with a new company.

As noted by Wonho himself, the star knows that his unwavering supporters made this opportunity possible saying, “I really appreciate the fans for giving me this opportunity.”But social media has bolstered progressive campaigns within Korean culture, too. The #MeToo movement has targeted powerful men, most notably the Korean film director Kim Ki-duk (on a 2018 South Korean news show, several actors accused him of sexual abuse, but Kim denied the accusations). The behemoth industry that is K-pop remains less affected by the #MeToo movement, but social media has provided positive platforms for young Korean women.

Following Naeun's phone-case scandal, her female and feminist fans showed support on Twitter with the hashtag #girlscandoanything, which started trending in Korea. And fans on social media are some of the most outspoken when it comes to K-pop's infamous no-dating rule, a clause in many idols' contracts that forbids them from being in a relationship. K-pop devotees are often cited as the reason for the ban in the first place (to preserve the fantasy of idols being single), but many have urged labels to ease up on this outdated rule.

K-pop's stars rarely speak out about negative experiences, but a handful of ex-idols have used social media to reveal a dark underbelly. One YouTuber, Maydoni, for example, has opened up about sleazy older men who surrounded her during idol training. A present-day idol has yet to use social media in a major way to expose K-pop's seedier side, but we've seen how hordes of fans can mobilize through the internet. Perhaps change lies with them. What is K-pop, after all, without its fans?

Even I wrote a column about finding purpose in quarantine. Yet despite increased awareness of mental health challenges during the pandemic, it seems to me that we can still pay more attention to the emotional needs that this virus has exacerbated. Especially at home in Long Island, where everyone knows someone affected by the virus, its impacts are much more intimate, and listless boredom is just one trivial tribulation.

For a while, I struggled to find a way to keep my emotions at bay. I could redirect my attention to work that I had to get done like helping out around the house, but all of this was a mere evasion from the inevitable emotive fog that would occupy my idle moments. But when I failed to evade the burden of feeling like the world around me was crashing down—I learned to escape to a happier place, through a medium that I had discovered once before: K-pop.

It seems trivial now in the face of the existential fight that the world is dealing with, but my first year of college was difficult. When I did get time to breathe and take a look out the window onto the lawns, I saw people who had it more figured out than I did, who navigated a world that they seemed to confidently call theirs. But somewhere in the middle of my first year, YouTube presented me with “Bad Boy,” the hit song of the year for the K-pop group Red Velvet. It was a nice song, so I put my problem set to rest, opened Spotify, and played the album on repeat.

As it kept playing, I felt a smile come across my face for the first time in a while. I wasn’t feeling some grandiose spiritual fulfillment but just an ephemeral rush of joy, the same feeling I got from the ice cream sandwiches I’d surreptitiously grab on my way out of JJ’s Place. I went back through Red Velvet’s discography and discovered that although the group’s music was simple, it was absolutely indispensable. Red Velvet was my safe place. Sure the music didn’t make me think, but it made me happy; it became one of those small comforts in life that gently nudges us to persevere.

I’m still listening to Red Velvet in quarantine. When every facet of my life is a brutal reminder that nothing is normal, I need to take the time to reassure myself that everything will be fine. I know that things will be different, but the point of being told that everything will be OK isn’t that life will go back to normal, but that there are a reason and way to push through all of this. And it is this purpose that Red Velvet’s music serves; it reminds me of what life was like before this whole mess and that it’ll be there for me through this difficult time.

Looking at the bigger picture, I think, as Columbia students, we’re often held to an extraordinary standard. For the many of us who started and will conclude our time here with incredible achievements, there is an expectation that we deprive ourselves of our indulgences in order to serve the greater community. As I believe many people in our community have been doing, we should continue to raise awareness, do good for society, and fight to protect what is right.

However, this standard has permeated the deepest spheres of our personal lives to the extent that many of us feel guilty for deviating even slightly from our productive endeavors. We exhibit a constant need, not only in our schoolwork and professional obligations, to feel as if we have accomplished something of value at the expense of more simple pleasures. While we might be able to make this sacrifice in normal times, when the material results of our endeavors were more accessible, when our livelihoods weren’t under the same perpetual threat, and when the institutions we attended were still functioning normally, it is my contention that now, more than ever, we must embrace unilateral happiness.

Of course, life isn’t easy by any means; I’m still susceptible to the emotional pressure caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but that won’t completely go away until the ramifications of this are well in the rearview mirror. Until then, it’s important to take note of the trivial joys in life. Those little moments, as basic and unimportant as they may seem, make everything feel brighter for just one second.

Maybe it’s the way your cat forgets to put his tongue back in after grooming himself or the smell of that steak your mom has overcooked again. Who am I to say? Part of finding joy in these personal moments is that they are personal to you. When it seems almost every aspect of our lives has been radically altered, it is in these secluded and unsullied moments that we retain ownership of our happiness. So yes, you’re allowed to be happy—and I’ll be wishing you well as I put another Red Velvet song on repeat, and let myself smile.

Jiyoon was part of the duo, also known as Bolbbalgan4, with Ahn Jiyoung.

Their label Shofar Music told fans that Jiyoung will continue as a soloist under BOL4 and release a new album in May this year.

In a handwritten letter, Jiyoon thanked fans for their support but admitted she had been considering leaving for some time.

‘It was a process of contemplating seriously about my future career, and it occurred to me that now is an important time for me to take on a new challenge before it’s too late,’ she said.

Jiyoon explained that Jiyoung and Shofar Music had tried to convince her to stay many times, but they eventually respected her decision.

She went on: ‘What I started in high school for fun has now grown into a team that many people lean their ears in to listen to, and I want to let you know that BOL4 is a precious memory to me.

‘Though I won’t be able to continue on as BOL4 like before, I will be a fan and a friend who watches over BOL4 and cheers it on. Thank you for being with me during my brightest moments. I love you.’

In a statement on their Instagram page, Shofar said: ‘Jiyoon expressed her intention to end her career as a Bolbbalgan4 member as a personal concern about her future career, and we had many times when we thought about it carefully together. The members have been talking for a long time and understood each other’s thoughts, and our Chopar Music Company also respected Jiyoon’s choice and concluded as follows.

‘BOL4 will now be a one-member artist with Ahn Ji Young and no additional members. After contemplation, Woo Ji Yoon has decided to wrap up promoting as BOL4.

‘We, Shofar Music, are also sad that BOL4 will not be able to continue on together, but we have made this decision to respect and support [Woo Ji Yoon’s] thoughts more than anything else. Moreover, although Ahn Ji Young and Woo Ji Yoon will wrap up promoting together as part of a duo, they will continue to be colleagues and friends who support the paths they each take.

‘The one-member BOL4 is currently preparing to release an album some time in May, and we ask you to send Ahn Ji Young, who will continue the music of BOL4, warm support and encouragement.

‘Shofar Music will continue to support the two artists’ shining future.’

BOL4 debuted in 2016 and released songs such as Workaholic, Travel and Stars Over Me.

MORE : Debbie Harry’s heroin addiction was a ‘drag’ due to effort needed to track it downWhile understanding Korean isn't a requirement, it can enrich the K-pop fandom experience, bringing fans closer to their idols and each other. Now, BTS is here to help.

When Laura Krupp started learning the Korean alphabet, or Hangul, she'd practice memorizing the characters by doodling the names of her favorite K-pop idols in the margins of her notebook. "정국," she'd scribble on the page, burning the distinct vowels and consonants of BTS member Jung Kook's name into memory. Amid a busy college semester, it took the geology major a month to master all 24 letters. "I probably could have learned it in a week if I had had more time," she tells MTV News over a video call from her bedroom in Michigan.

Three years later, the 21-year-old can read Korean phonetically and knows the basics: how to introduce herself; how to count to 10; and how to read and pronounce the go-to Instagram hashtag of her ultimate bias, as favored idols are known in the K-pop fandom, Lee Know. (The hashtag "#리노는기여어," which roughly translates to "#LeeKnowIsCute," connects her to thousands of posts from fans around the world who use it too.) She admits that the process has been slow. Juggling a full course load with teaching herself Korean grammar hasn't been easy, but she revels in the small victories. "I've left a couple of comments in Korean on Lee Know's Instagram posts," she says, his poster one of many crowding the bedroom wall behind her. And when she met Stray Kids earlier this year at a fan engagement on their District 9: Unlock tour, she was able to tell youngest member I.N, "행복하세요," or, "I wish you happiness."

"I was going to tell Seungmin that I liked his voice [in Korean], but he smiled at me and my brain short-circuited," she says. "So I didn't get to say that."

While understanding Korean isn't a requirement to take part in K-pop standom, it can enrich the experience. In K-pop, content is king. A group can produce hundreds of hours of interviews, livestreams, performances, digital programming, and more during a single promotional cycle. Depending on the company's internal resources, as well as the size of the unit's global following, subtitles and translations can take days to weeks to months to be added, if at all.

And international fans know just how agonizing waiting for subtitles can be. 20-year-old fan Nico, from Ohio, became so frustrated by the lack of translated content available for one of her favorite girl groups, Weki Meki, that she took matters into her own hands. "Smaller girl groups don't get any [English] translations because there's not a big demand for them," she says. "So I pledged to myself that I would learn Korean so that I could help international fans of these girl groups have translations for social media posts and V Lives." She's still working toward that goal ("I'm so close!" she says), but she did join a Weki Meki fan account to help organize global streaming parties.

For most, the desire to learn Korean stems from something as simple as wanting to connect with idols on a deeper level. 22-year-old media studies student Lissete Vega started learning Korean in 2015 because she wanted to sing along with her favorite SHINee songs. "I wanted to better understand them through their language and also through their culture," she says. Now, she meets with a private tutor once or twice a week and she's able to understand "most of what BTS tweets without having to wait for translating accounts to do it, which is an awesome feeling." She says, "Just being able to connect with them without having to rely so much on outside resources like subtitles or translations has been really beneficial."

It's a sentiment a lot of K-pop fans share. After all, there are nuances that don't always translate well. While music often transcends language, jokes may not. "Namjoon's dad jokes are really hard to get if you don't speak Korean, but once you do, they're so stupidly funny," 20-year-old Hannah Smith says. The New York University student and multifandom K-pop enthusiast has been teaching herself Korean for years via free online resources; she plans to take Korean as her foreign language elective. "It's an academic way of consuming my entertainment," she adds.

It's also a facet of being part of an increasingly globalized fandom. "Now, practically every fan I meet at least knows how to read Hangul," Vega says.

But K-pop superfans aren’t the only people interested in learning the language. A 2018 report from the Modern Language Association showed an increase in Korean class enrollments across college campuses in the United States by 13.7 percent between 2013 and 2016, while the overall number of language registrations decreased. But even as universities across the country cut foreign language departments altogether, the general rise in popularity of Korean sees many people, like Krupp, teaching themselves. Free resources like Talk To Me In Korean, How To Study Korean, Duolingo, and YouTube make the learning process more accessible to millions of eager students. Roughly 3.3 million people practice their Korean on Duolingo, making it the sixth-most popular course among English learners on the language-learning app after it was added to the platform in late 2017. Meanwhile, three times a week YouTuber Korean Unnie teaches everything from must-know words and phrases (in both formal and informal speech) to grammar to cultural nuances on her popular channel.

And now, global superstars BTS have joined the mix: Just as Friends helped BTS leader RM learn English, BTS want to help their fans learn Korean.

Two weeks ago, Big Hit Entertainment launched "Learn Korean With BTS," a new online program that integrates language-learning into pre-existing BTS videos. Over the course of 30 free, short-form episodes uploaded weekly to their official fansite on WeVerse, the initiative aims to make learning Korean "easy and fun for global fans who have difficulty enjoying BTS's music and contents due to the language barrier," according to a statement from the company.

"It's a very nice way to bring together this massive fandom who are very much interested in learning," says Monica Yadav, a culture writer and K-pop enthusiast based in Mumbai, India. She started teaching herself Korean through YouTube and webtoons to better understand the depth of BTS's lyricism, which is largely rooted in literature and philosophy. "Those seven boys have so much power to influence so many people."

For Jesse*, a 27-year-old Asian-American publicist from San Francisco, California, the fact that they're using their power "to do something positive makes me feel even better about my choice to be a fan." But it also signifies what makes the industry so unique. "The way that K-pop actively invites its fans to be a part of the whole experience isn't really paralleled in Western music," she says. "It's a participatory experience. There's so much to do, and so much they ask you to do, that learning the language has helped me feel more involved as a fan."

Devised by Professor Heo Yong of Hankuk University and researchers at the Korea Language Contents Institute, the curriculum five episodes in has covered pronunciation of consonants, introductions, numbers, and key phrases like "thank you" and "how have you been?" — all while using memorable clips from the group's numerous variety programs and broadcasts as teaching aids. Reading "안녕하세요" is an accomplishment, but hearing singer Jimin cutely say "annyonghaseyo" gives learners a better grasp on the language entirely. This is especially important for beginners.

"It's important to learn pronunciation and annunciation properly if you're starting to learn Korean," Eun Oh, a manager and teacher at Korean Culture Center of New York, says. "From a linguistic perspective, pronunciation is the foundation of communication." Oh encourages her students to avidly consume all types of Korean media, from dramas to music to Korean variety shows, to not only improve listening comprehension but to also familiarize themselves with how Koreans speak.

"I do like hearing Korean spoken naturally," 26-year-old fan Lindsey Bosak says. "I feel like it's a good way to figure out what I'm saying incorrectly." Bosak first started teaching herself Korean three years ago with the hope of one day being able to multitask while watching Korean dramas. ("I wanted to be able to do things while watching TV, like clean," she suggests.) But it wasn't until discovering BTS that she got serious about her studies, purchasing textbooks and practicing on apps throughout the day. "I started reading lyric translations, and I fell in love with the way that they write and the topics they talk about," she explains. "I wanted to be able to understand that on my own and not have to follow along with lyric sheets."

Bosak turned to BTS content to brush up on her skills, like Bangtan Bombs on YouTube and episodes of Run! BTS and Bon Voyage, which are available on V Live and WeVerse. "It's always a little exciting when I recognize a word without looking at the subtitles," she says. "I do try and test myself. When I learn new words, I like to watch [variety program] Run! BTS to see if I know anything. I really like hearing native speakers. It helps with pronunciation."

This is what Jon Hills, director of New York-based language center Hills Learning, refers to as "authentic material." Basically, it's something that has been written or spoken by a native speaker for a native speaker. "In the language-learning world, there are textbooks and a variety of tools that are written by Korean speakers for English speakers," Hills says. "But there's been a move to try and integrate more authentic materials. A song or a piece of content from BTS is technically an authentic material. So what they're trying to do makes sense. You're learning Korean from an authentic source."

Still, a device like "Learn Korean With BTS" is best used as a supplement. "It's not a beginner course," Bosak says after binging the first three episodes. "They do expect you to have a basic understanding of the Korean alphabet. I had to watch them a few times because they go so quickly. There's not a lot of time to stop and digest what they're saying. But I like the fact that they're using old content. BTS has been such a big part of my life the last few years that I think this is a way for me to stick with it. It's an incentive."

And motivation is the key to learning any language. And part of that incentive, Hills says, is "having external stimulants that you can watch and engage with." But no matter how someone was introduced to the culture, be it through K-pop or Bong Joon Ho films, learning Korean is ultimately a long-term goal. "I really respect K-pop fans' curiosity and love for the language," Oh says. "But I would love to see that it goes beyond K-pop. BTS is opening a new door for [fans] to be introduced to a new world, just like how language has opened so many doors for me — to talk to people, to interact with people, to understand people."

"There's a whole other world out there," Hills says. "There are a lot of perspectives out there that are not just Western."

In their initial press announcement, Big Hit said that through learning Korean with BTS the company hopes "global fans will be able to deeply empathize" with the music of their artists. But, in the process, they’re helping fans empathize with one another. "I've had full conversations with other fans [online] where they're speaking in Korean, and I respond in English, and they respond in Korean," Smith says. "Because they understand English but can't write it, and I understand Korean but can't write it. So we communicate that way."

"It breaks down the barriers between Korean and international fans," Ciara adds. The 24-year-old activist from Dublin, Ireland, started learning the language after gradually picking up words after hours-long marathons of BTS content. Though it's only been seven months since she began teaching herself Korean, she's already experienced the joy of understanding something before it's been subtitled. And she's excited to start "Learn Korean With BTS."

"They understand that this is something their fans are passionate about," she says. "Especially with a lot of the fandom devalued or being belittled — a lot of that rooted in misogyny. It's a testament to fans caring about what these artists are saying and not just what people assume fans care about."

And with a better understanding of the world comes a better understanding of yourself and how you fit into it. "It's made it feel like a smaller world, especially in this time where there's so much going on that's negative," Bosak says. "It's really nice to have something to connect with people over. And I'm meeting people that I probably never would have met had I not started learning Korean."

Back in her bedroom in Michigan, Krupp sums it up perfectly: "It's boring being monolingual, honestly."

*Last name withheld for privacyThere are a lot of incredibly talented K-pop idols out there, but some truly go above and beyond. Their special skills make them amazing dancers and overall awesome performers, and we’re willing to bet that in another life they could’ve been gymnasts too. From unbelievable flips and tricks to some mind-boggling flexibility feats, here are nine K-pop idols that wow us with their athletic abilities.

He may seem unassuming at first, but never underestimate the power of SEVENTEEN’s The8! He should get points for his super suave mannerism alone – the way in which he casually pulls off this incredible feat of tumbling have the hosts of “Ask Us Anything” (and viewers too!) totally stunned. If he can pull this off in a dress shirt and slacks, there’s no doubt he’d be a phenomenal gymnast!

Cheng Xiao has repeatedly floored viewers with her gorgeous rhythmic gymnastics routines, and it’s not too much of a stretch to say that her skills would make her an amazing gymnast too! Sometimes she seems more liquid than human thanks to her incredible flexibility and natural grace. Her background in traditional Chinese dance definitely sets her on the path to idol/gymnast stardom!

Don’t miss the rest of the 2016 Chuseok “Idol Star Athletics Championships”!

Another idol with a background in Chinese dance, WinWin’s skill and grace when dancing definitely makes him a standout in the K-pop world. Plus, his tricks are so fluid that he almost seems to hover in the air before landing lightly on the ground. The ease with which he can pull off a range of incredible acrobatic feats and his remarkable flexibility make him a great candidate for gymnastics.

f(x)’s leader Victoria has been making jaws drop with her frankly unbelievable flexibility ever since the group’s debut. The control she has when contorting her body into a number of mind-boggling positions speaks to her amazing core strength and technique, which would definitely come in handy in the world of gymnastics. Even a pair of heels doesn’t seem to phase her when it comes to showing off her capabilities!

ASTRO’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” themed performance on “Idol Star Athletics Championships” was memorable for more than one reason, but Rocky’s amazing tumbling routine right at the beginning of the event was definitely a big part of it! The clean round-off-back-handspring combination had everyone shook, and confirmed what AROHAs were probably suspecting all along: Rocky was definitely a gymnast in another life!

Yein’s natural grace and amazing coordination make her an amazing dancer and performer, but those skills also lend themselves to some pretty cool gymnastics abilities as well. Her knack for making difficult tricks look super easy is a big part of what makes her so fun to watch, and her lively energy really shines through on the gymnastics floor. Plus, her flexibility is nothing to shake your head at either!

These two were well-known for their crazy tumbling and death-defying choreography back in the early days of GOT7’s career, and Ahgases definitely haven’t forgotten! There seems to be no end to the number of heart-stopping tricks that Mark and Jackson can pull off, and their powerful moves mean that they’re probably gold medal-winning gymnasts in an alternate universe!

Yiren first made a name for herself on Mnet’s “Produce 48,” thanks to her Chinese dance capabilities that are every bit as flawless as her fairy-like visuals. Her flexibility and control make her a beautiful performer, and we’re willing to bet that those skills would lend themselves to an amazing gymnastics career as well. Now that she’s a member of the fire rookie girl group EVERGLOW, hopefully she’ll get to show off even more of her amazing skills!

Jimin has been flooring people with his dance abilities ever since debut, and his tumbling tricks are no joke either. His classical dance background means that he’s super flexible, and his fluidity and coordination would definitely make him a great gymnast. It’s always amazing to see how BTS manages to incorporate his skills into their performance choreographies, and Jimin pulls it off perfectly!

Does your favorite idol have some super cool gymnastics capabilities? Sound off in the comments!Tomorrow X Together will return with a brand new mini album next month.

The K-pop group’s comeback The Dream Chapter: ETERNITY will be the finale to their Dream Chapter album series.

The Dream Chapter: ETERNITY comes out 18 May.

The five-member group debuted under Big Hit Entertainment in March 2019 and went on to score a nomination at the MTV VMAs the same year in the best K-pop category.

MORE : Dua Lipa and BBC News theme mash-up is the certified banger you never knew you neededI started listening to K-pop in high school, when my cousin introduced me to TVXQ. Listening to non-English pop, as an Asian-American teen, blew my mind and made me feel less alone as the only Taiwanese kid in my school. They were as talented as the boy bands I grew up with, like *NSYNC and B2K, but polylingual — sometimes debuting songs in Chinese, too — and looked more like me than my neighbors. I found a community of girls online who were just as obsessed as I was. If I was awake, I was probably logged on to my private K-pop-exclusive Twitter, crying over the last performances of my favorite groups, and wondering how much the tickets would cost if they ever toured in New York.

The dark side of K-pop made listening to the music more addictive. Every day felt like it might bring seismic change to my borrowed world. In 2009, almost as soon as I had “met” them, members of TVXQ took their management to court over their Draconian 13-year contracts. When the internet excavated 2PM leader Jay Park’s years-old MySpace and found careless comments about his trainee experience, there was a petition encouraging his suicide circulating hours later. Just as one scandal reached a fever pitch, another would ignite. It was exciting to love K-pop because it seemed so tenuous and dramatic and harrowing. But in a way that wouldn’t affect me personally — these young people weren’t actually my friends. This was Shakespearean tragedy you could listen to on your iPod, back when you owned such a thing. Who could say no?

Well, plenty of people actually. Americans often questioned my K-pop obsession. Outsiders would look on at K-pop with derision, pity, confusion. Idols changed their entire style — including getting plastic surgery — at a high frequency. Westerners would tell me they had a hard time keeping up. Faces seemed to change all the time, they said. It must be exhausting, they said. I considered these opinions racist – David Bowie and Lady Gaga changed their looks constantly as a point of artistry, so why not Asian stars? I would watch my idols change — or refuse to change, despite the expectations to do so — and get even more invested in their stories. These people were only a few years older than me and were already beautiful, graceful, relentlessly productive. It was incredible ­— but also another level of this darkness. I loved them because they were good at their jobs, but I was afraid for them, too. Their makeovers — for some double-eyelid surgery, for others jaw reshaping or rhinoplasty — were said to be encouraged and or paid for by their management companies and added to a debt they had to work their way out of once they debuted.

“As an artist, you know being attractive will get you more attention...and get you the center position [in a group],” explained independent artist Grazy Grace, in a YouTube video on her experience as a trainee (parlance for fledging idol) in the K-pop industry. “Nobody is putting a gun to your head. It’s honestly the opposite... When [an idol is] doing camera tests and know they’re going to debut in front of so many people, they feel the need to correct, even [just] a little.”
• Two Tiktokers have come under fire for appearing to lift choreography from K-pop girl group Apink as part of a new dance challenge.
• Fans were swift to call out the similarities between the two dances, and creator @jazlynebaybee later gave credit to Apink both in the comments of her original video and in the description of a repost of the dance.
• The incident is part of a common problem on TikTok with crediting dances, which spread quickly across the app.

Two TikTok creators, @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice, came under fire Monday for posting a video featuring a dance challenge that appears to have been lifted from a bit of choreography performed by K-pop girl group Apink. The pair posted videos of a two-person dance on each of their respective accounts, with @ashlynmarieprice calling it a "sister challenge," shouting out TikTok sisters Charli and Dixie D'Amelio in the description to do it as well. However, fans were quick to point out the similarities between the dance they performed and choreography from K-pop girl group Apink's latest single, "Dumhdurum."

The dance in question has already gone viral in K-pop fan communities on Twitter for its mind-bending choreography. "Dumhdurum" was choreographed by Freemind, a studio that recently posted the original choreo demo for the song and has worked on other K-pop titles like fromis_9's "Fun."

Upon finding both of @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice's videos, which have received approximately 75,000 and 7,200 likes, respectively, Apink fans (known by their fandom name, Pink Panda) were quick to call out the similarities between the dances in the comments and on Twitter. Both creators responded to commentors on TikTok videos, making comments like "okay TikTok cops" or "tell that to everyone else who uses different songs to different dances and routine." News of the dance video quickly spread across stan Twitter, with fans encouraging others to call out both creators.

Eventually, @jazlynebaybee gave credit in the comments of her own post, where she wrote, "Thank you for the inspiration @official_apink2011 choreographed @fm_thai76 & @juice0425." On Tuesday morning, she re-uploaded the dance, this time using "Dumhdurum" as the audio and crediting Apink in the description. In a TikTok livestream, she said that she came across the dance on TikTok, where it was set to the sound that she and @ashlynmarieprice danced to. "I would have totally done it to their song, I just didn't know it was to that song. When I saw it on TikTok, there was no credit, no nothing, I just thought it was an old clip," she said.

Insider has reached out to both @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice and will update with any comment.

This is far from the first time creators have been accused of lifting dances from other sources on TikTok. The most famous example is that of the "Renegade" dance, which was created by Jalaiah Harmon and posted on Instagram before another creator brought it to TikTok without credit. "Renegade" eventually became the biggest dance on the app, and Jalaiah eventually did get mainstream credit, but there were months between when the dance came to TikTok in October and when became well-known as its creator around Feb. 2020.

That's not to say that Apink, a famous girl group, faces the same kind of consequences of having a dance taken as a small creator — the swift fandom backlash against @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice is testament to that. However, the full incident is just another notch in TikTok's dance crediting problem, in which dances are frequently picked up by creators who popularize them without giving credit to the original creators.
• The original 'Renegade' dance creator performed at the NBA All-Star Game and met up with Charli D'Amelio for a TikTok Collab
• A mysterious fake K-pop girl group fooled fans for days, and this isn't the first time it's happened
• BTS fans are celebrating what would have been the first day of the group's postponed 'Map of the Soul' tour by posting covers, concert videos, and artSunmi, who turns 28 on May 2, has been keeping quiet about any post-pandemic projects on social media. Here’s what we know about her …Everyone's excited about Lady Gaga's at-home event called One World: Together At Home which is held to help support the World Health Organization and the healthcare workers globally. Many artists, actors, musicians, and celebrities from around the world are taking part to thank all of those front-liners who are risking their lives to protect humanity.

In fact, the sensational K-pop boy group, SuperM is part of the line up too and fans are more than excited to see them perform. You might be wondering who SuperM is and why fans are all hyped up about them.

Super M is a South Korean group that was formed in 2019 by the well-known SM Entertainment and Capitol Music Group. The group has seven members; Taemin from Shinee, Baekhyun and Kai from EXO, Taeyong, and Mark from NCT 127 and Ten and Lucas from WayV.

The Korean labels wanted to create a group that would help capture the attention of people around the world towards Korean pop. Chris Lee, A&R execute at SM Entertainment told Billboard that he wanted to create a synergy between their groups, them as solo acts, and the SuperM group to create a big wave in this K-pop industry.

"There's already an Iron Man, a Thor and so on; and just like how the Avengers can have their own successful movies, there is a different kind of energy when they are together as The Avengers," Lee told.

Noted by Korea Times, the Super in SuperM stands for 'Super' and the M stands for 'Matrix' or 'Master' as the members are already an established star in their respective bands.

SuperM was enlisted by South Korea's biggest airline Korean Air. They will appear in their in-flight safety video featuring their track, Let's Go Everywhere as well as another K-pop artist from the same company, BoA.

SuperM first appeared on American television with Ellen DeGeneres. According to Hybebae, they spoke about their debut, taught Ellen how to dance to their dynamic song Jopping and even portrayed their interest in saving the Earth by donating $50,000 USD to the Ellen Fund for global conservation efforts.

BTS who is also known as the Bangtan Boys was the first K-pop boy group to stay an entire year straight on Billboard 200. However, it was manifest that another K-pop boy band had to follow their footsteps. Eventually, it was SuperM's first debut mini-album that kept its spot on the list for four consecutive weeks after it was ranked number one.

Last But Not The Least

SuperM has been the only South Korean group to perform at Lady Gaga's personally curated virtual concert. With each of their specialties, they form a formidable team that's certainly attracting the Westerners.

"I feel like how we're assembled itself is a very futuristic step that K-pop hasn't ever seen before. Who knows what kind of road this may pave," Mark, the youngest member of SuperM told TIME. "But we just wanted to show how we can bring different elements together in one-- and have that be expressed onstage in a powerful way."

The event will air on April 18th starting at 8 p.m ET on ABC, NBC, CBS, AXS, Univision, National Geographic and Bell Media. It will also stream on Apple, Amazon Prime Video, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitch, TuneIn, and Twitter so there's no way SuperM stans can miss their favorite band's performance!

So forget about everything, grab your bowl of popcorn and tune in right now to witness the biggest celebrities and in Lady Gaga's words to 'celebrate the frontline communities, health-care workers and their acts of kindness.'

“Four Weeks of mercy, 30 days of worship, 720 hours of Spirituality. 43,200 Minutes of Forgiveness, 2592000 Seconds of Happiness, Ramadan Kareem Mubarak,” the K-Pop boy band member wrote in the group’s official Twitter page.

Quite oddly enough, the Malaysian K-Pop singer added a TikTok video of him taking on the emoji face challenge in the post. In response to his tweet, fans soon commented and thanked the artist for his wishes.

Over the last few years, other K-Pop bands such as BTS wished fans a Ramadan Kareem during an interview with KBS World Radio Arabic in 2015. Back in May, Benji from boy group B.I.G — known for singing Arabic cover songs — told Gulf News that his group would all like to fast for Ramadan for a day.

“If we’re going to do a global cover project, it should extend beyond ‘we sing different languages’. Experience the culture,” he said. “If you’re going to do something and you’re going to receive that much support, that’s the least you can do.”

Isaac has been actively promoting the all-male band since October 2017. Originally formed from survival show Boys24 with eight members, Jinsub departed the group in 2018 while Sunghyun followed a year later.

Alongside soloist AleXa, IN2IT garnered attention last year for embarking on their first tour in India and especially for their Bollywood-style dance cover of ‘The Jawaani Song’ from movie ‘Student Of The Year 2’.

As of the end of January, the group’s remaining members — Inpyo, Inho, Hyunuk, Jiahn, Yeontae and Isaac — reportedly parted ways with MMO Entertainment and continued independently.
• K-pop idol Chen, who is a member of boy group EXO, reportedly had his first child on April 29, which his company, SM Entertainment, confirmed per Soompi.
• He announced in January 2020 that he was soon to be married and expecting a child with his fiancée.

Chen, whose real name is Kim Jong-dae, has welcomed his first child into the world alongside his wife. A member of EXO, one of the biggest K-pop boy bands in the world, Chen announced in January 2020 that he was not only getting married, but that his wife was pregnant with their first child. "I have a girlfriend I want to spend the rest of my life with... a blessing came my way," Chen wrote in a letter to fans, per a translation by Soompi. On April 29, Soompi reported that SM Entertainment, the entertainment company to which Chen is signed, had confirmed that Chen had given birth to a daughter.

Fans of Chen and his group, EXO, were quick to celebrate the news on social media, responding with overwhelming support, working to drown out any negative discussions. In January, The Korea Herald reported on a protest some EXO fans held outside an SM Entertainment complex in Gangnam in which they demanded that Chen leave EXO as a result of the announcement. At the same time, many fans were quick to express their support for Chen with hashtags like #AlwayswithCHEN or #EXOLBelievesInEXO9, referring to the fandom's name, EXO-L, and the nine current members of EXO.

That support has largely carried over to news of Chen's daughter, with many EXO-Ls and Soondingies — the name Chen gave to his fans — taking to social media to show an outpouring of love and support, trending #종대야_축하해 (which means "Jongdae, congratulations") and #WelcomEXOPrincess worldwide.

Many were also quick to point out the serendipitous timing: Chen first debuted as a member of EXO in April 2012, and later debuted as a soloist with his album "April, and a Flower" in April 2019.

While there was a bit of friction due to negative hashtags, fan discussion on Twitter was overwhelmingly supportive, with many highlighting the need to respect Chen and his family's privacy.

The singer and actor had been in Japan working as a producer on the Japanese talent show G-EGG, which aims to discover a new boy band.

Yoon Hak had arrived back in Korea from Japan on March 24 and visited a special testing centre in Seocho District, southern Seoul, on Tuesday after he began showing symptoms of the virus.

He was transferred to Seoul Medical Center, in eastern Seoul, after his test results came back positive.

He is currently being treated in an isolation facility and it's said that his symptoms are mild.

A representative for Yoon Hak, whose real name in Jung Yoon-Hak, has confirmed to news outlets that he is receiving treatment.

They said: "After returning to Korea on March 24 following his individual promotions in Japan, Yoon Hak was diagnosed with COVID-19 on April 1.

"Currently, Yoon Hak is hospitalized and receiving treatment. His symptoms are mild. He will be focusing on treatment and recovery. His manager, stylists, and other staff members have all tested negative."

It's said he is the fist Korean celebrity to test positive for the virus.

Yoon Hak enlisted for his two years of mandatory military service on Christmas Day in 2011, and was discharged in July 24, 2013.

He released his Japanese solo debut single after his enlistment had ended.

He had recorded the song before beginning his service.

He made his debut in group Supernova in 2007 and has been mainly active in Japan since then.

He has also starred in dramas Fates and Furies and My Unfortunate Boyfriend.'There's a rule that nobody is allowed to eat in the vocal practice room — I have eaten a tiny energy bar very secretly,' Allen tells MTV News

In their electrifying debut single "Break All The Rules," the nine members of Cravity boldly claim, "I’ll be what I want to be / I paint my future as I see." It's a confident declaration for a group so new — a whole week old — in a competitive industry like K-pop where futures and success aren't always guaranteed. And yet, coming from these voracious rookies, it sounds more like a promise than an empty platitude. Even their album title is, in part, a command — Hideout: Remember Who We Are.

Of course, hailing from a company like Starship Entertainment, home to superstars Monsta X, affords them a sense of confidence that's equal parts intimidating and invigorating for the young artists. Those complex emotions are expressed throughout the release's seven tracks — from the rebellious spirit urging them to let go of expectation on "Break All The Rules" and "Blackout," to the vulnerability on softer B-sides "Stay" and "Star." In many ways, the album is a dramatic expression of the push-and-pull of youth. The members, ranging in ages from 16 to 21, can relate to these constantly changing feelings; one minute they're all bravado and wild instinct on the "Top of the Chain," and the next they're in need of a guiding light through the darkness of adolescence.

"We want to be a Hideout for our fans, to give them comfort and happiness," dancer Hyeongjun tells MTV News amidst a hectic promotional schedule. "It’s a message to let the world know about Cravity, to remember us, so each song contains our strong ambition," vocalist Wonjin adds. That ambition is even reflected in their name, a portmanteau of the words "creativity" and "gravity" and a reference to the "center of gravity" they find when they're together.

They're fresh from their debut showcase on April 14 — streamed online in light of the global coronavirus pandemic, which has put concerts and events on indefinite hold — and it still feels surreal to members Serim, Allen, Jungmo, Woobin, Wonjin, Minhee, Hyeongjun, Taeyoung, and Seongmin. After all, just a few weeks ago they were still trainees pulling all-nighters in practice rooms. So, how did they celebrate the big milestone? With cake and a spread of their favorite foods, of course.

"After the showcase, all the staff members prepared a cake for us, and we all celebrated together," leader and rapper Serim says. "We were truly thankful, some of us even cried because we were just too happy," Hyeongjun adds.

Below, the members of Cravity tell MTV News how they really feel about their debut, where they get their confidence from, the lessons they learned from their time as trainees (including the advice that Monsta X's Joohoney gave them), and reveal just how many rules they've broken in real life.

MTV News: Congrats on your debut! Does the reality of debuting match the expectations you had in your heads?

Serim: I imagined performing in front of our fans, so I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't do it due to the situations going on worldwide. But I still imagine and dream about the performance in front of our fans.

Wonjin: I don't think I have ever imagined I would make my debut with such great interest and love from a lot of people. It made me promise myself to do my best for the debut, and I became more thankful to our fans who gave us support and love.

Taeyoung: It was unbelievable! I think it was filled with more excitement and happiness than I ever imagined.

MTV News: You all worked really hard as trainees to achieve your dreams of debuting. What's the biggest lesson you learned as a trainee?

Seongmin: I learned to always live with gratitude.

Jungmo: Don't give up, try hard, and trust yourself with persistence.

Allen: I learned that if you don’t give up on your dream, you can achieve it. Sometimes I wanted to give up on it, but I think I was able to make my dream come true by only looking forward and putting all my efforts in it.

MTV News: What's each of your favorite songs on your debut album, Hideout: Remember Who We Are, and why?

Serim: It is a song called "낯섦" [English title "Stay"] because I usually enjoy listening to the songs that are emotional — the ones that are great for the dawn.

Allen: My favorite song is "Top of the Chain." It is the first track of our debut album, and I think it perfectly fits our grandeur appearance. Whenever I listen to this track, I get a strong sense of confidence.

Jungmo: My favorite song is "별" [English title "Star"]. The stars in the lyrics represent our fans and the members being a guiding light, so it is very emotionally touching.

Hyeongjun: My favorite is "Star," too. I like the fact that it is metaphoric in terms that it contains the message that Cravity wants to deliver to the fans — they are guiding us.

Woobin: I like our title song "Break all the Rules." It is a song that shows our unique, colorful sounds. For myself, I think it is also the song that expresses Cravity the most.

Wonjin: For me, it's "Cloud 9." When I listen to this track, not only do I feel good, but it also gives me energy and excitement. I think it is easy to listen to.

Minhee: It's a song called “Jumper." Other songs are good too, but when I listen to this track or when I’m performing it on the stage, I enjoy it the most.

Taeyoung: I really like "Blackout." I think it would be cool to imagine us performing this song on stage. It has a lot of energy.

Seongmin: "Break all the Rules" is my favorite. It's a catchy song with an addictive melody that circles around my ears repeatedly.

MTV News: Your debut single "Break All The Rules" is really bold and sends a powerful, nonconformist message with lyrics like "I’ll be what I want to be / I paint my future as I see." Are you this confident in real life?

Serim: I'm not the person that is always confident about myself, but being a member of Cravity made me stronger. I have a lot more confidence now.

Allen: Yes, I wouldn't have dreamed of becoming an artist if I didn't have confidence.

Jungmo: I always want to be a confident person and myself and our members are all working hard on it. As a member of Cravity, I feel much more confident. I am happy and proud of myself.

Woobin: There are times when my confidence diminishes, but I think that those are the times when I grow the most. I can improve from those moments.

Wonjin: I did not have much confidence in myself. So, I always agonized a lot about my future and had experienced harsh times alone. However, I was able to withstand and overcome all of those worries with [my] members, who were always beside me to listen to what I’m saying. And also, our fans who have sent us a lot of cheering messages made me become more confident.

Minhee: I think my confidence is a bit lower than the bold, powerful lyrics of our title track. But I am trying my best to have the same level of confidence when I’m on the stage. I think I can gain more confidence by being with my members.

Hyeongjun: As our title song contains our strong and bold ambition towards society, I think I am a newly debuted rookie filled with enough confidence. But when I'm with the members who support and give me energy, it makes my confidence go up.

Taeyoung: All of our members are quite confident, but I think among the members, I am most confident.

Seongmin: I usually try to believe in myself, and this belief makes my confidence grow. But I think I was able to become a member of Cravity because I worked very hard and did not give up on it. Now, I feel that I’m the one who can and will achieve the goal if I have one.

MTV News: When did you know you wanted to be a performer? Was there a certain moment or artist that inspired you?

Serim: When I was young, I was so happy to dance in front of people while I was in a dance club. So, I tried to be a celebrity.

Allen: When I was in my first year of middle school, I did a dance cover of SHINee's "Lucifer." Being on a stage was very exciting for me and I enjoyed performing in front of others. From then, I dreamed about being a K-pop idol and wanted to be like SHINee one day in the future.

Jungmo: My role model and artist who inspired me is V from BTS. I am learning by watching V's facial expressions and performance. He made me dream of becoming a singer.

Woobin: When I saw the performance of TVXQ's song, “MIROTIC," I knew that I wanted to be a person who sings and dances on stage.

Wonjin: I started out as a child actor, and at first it was interesting and fun, but that feeling did not last long. Then I started dancing, and I wanted to feel how I felt when I was on stage in a small show, so I developed my dream as a singer.

Minhee: It was Monsta X. When I first joined the company, I was amazed by their performances. They made me want to work harder.

Hyeongjun: I felt impressed when I saw EXO's "Growl" performance, and I had a clear dream of becoming a celebrity since I was in ninth grade.

Taeyoung: I became interested in dancing after I did a talent show when I was in elementary school. But I didn't dream of becoming a singer until I was street-casted for the first time. [Ed. note: In the Korean entertainment industry, it's common for casting agents to scout popular locations and recruit young talent for their companies.] That's when it started to become real for me.

Seongmin: The idea of dancing and singing on the stage was always impressive to me, but my dream of becoming an entertainer grew little by little. I saw a music show by chance and the excitement of it made me want to be a performer.

MTV News: You guys seem to have great chemistry as a group. Are there general interests that you share, or ways that you've bonded as a team?

Seongmin: After the daily schedule, we get together and talk, and we talk a lot. We have time to monitor each other, encourage each other, and fix each other's inconveniences, and I think we can get along well without fighting because of these opportunities. We can all talk to each other because we have faith in each other.

Jungmo: We try our best and care about each other a lot.

Wonjin: We all like jokes. When we are together, we joke around, laugh, and talk, and I think we have become a team with good chemistry.

MTV News: Joohoney from Monsta X produced the high-energy track "Jumper." What was that experience like? What did you learn from working with an established artist like Joohoney?

Serim: He taught us a lot of ways to perform with energy onstage. He took the time to teach us even though he was busy, and he helped us a lot by letting us know about how to make gestures and key points. I think our team's performance was more complete thanks to him telling us about his actual experience.

Minhee: I still have a long way to go, but I was able to learn each and every sense of singing and performing from him. There are so many things I want to learn and ask, so I hope I get another chance to meet him.

Wonjin: It was great to learn and feel the unique energy that he has. We were able to finish our debut stage well because he taught us a lot of things that we couldn't know without actually experiencing it.

MTV News: Joohoney said he worked really hard to showcase each of your strengths as artists. So I'm wondering: How would you each describe your strengths?

Serim: I think my strength is that I have my own style. While preparing for this performance, I tried to express the charm that I can show by researching and thinking of various gestures. My goal is to let many people know my own style.

Allen: I think one of my strengths is ability to speak in different languages and to communicate with fans from various countries.

Jungmo: I think it is the tone I have. I was happy to start the single with my voice.

Woobin: I want to say that my voice is also my strength. I have a large vocal range, so I have a variety of genres that I can show you. I think I will have many chances to sing good songs.

Wonjin: Like Jungmo, I think the tone of my voice is an advantage. It has a unique color that you can notice, like, "This is Wonjin's part!" But as a group, I think the facial expressions that we show on stage are one of our charms.

Hyeongjun: I want to tell you about the strength of Cravity. The strength we have is that we always have fun dancing, and we bring that excitement and energy out in our performance.

Taeyoung: I am versatile in many ways and have enough confidence to make use of my talent.

Seongmin: I think my clear, unique tone and various facial expressions are my strong points.

MTV News: What is something, other than performing and your fans, that makes you happy?

Serim: I am interested in fashion, so I look for fashion-related things.

Jungmo: After a daily schedule, lying in bed and resting makes me happy.

Woobin: Cooking! I am interested in food and I like to eat, so I cook whenever I have time. I think it's killing two birds with one stone because cooking relieves stress and allows me to eat delicious food.

Wonjin: I think I am happiest when I am with the members. Each of us is unique, but we have a lot of fun together as nine. It feels like we are relieving stress. We sometimes play mafia games together, and that always makes me happy.

Minhee: I'm happy while playing games and watching movies alone.

Hyeongjun: These days, I'm reading the fans' messages on our official fancafe. I also look at the photos posted by the members, and that makes me happy.

Taeyoung: Exercising and dancing are two things I love to do. And I always enjoy playing games.

Seongmin: Watching movies or dramas while eating something delicious always makes me happy.

MTV News: Your debut album is titled Remember Who We Are, so what's your most memorable moment?

Serim: I remember having a day out with my mom when I was in middle school. I rarely came to Seoul at that age, but I remember going to Myeong-dong with my mom to play and eat delicious food. It's one of my favorite memories.

Jungmo: I lived in New Zealand for several years when I was young. I think because I went there when I was young, I remember being happy without any worries.

Wonjin: When we were trainees, I invited Hyeongjun and Minhee to my house. The next day was Hyeongjun's birthday, so I remember Minhee and I cooked some food for his birthday. We saw the recipe and made it. It was my first time preparing it, so it was awkward and sloppy, but I was proud that Hyeongjun enjoyed eating it.

Minhee: I still remember the first time I saw all the members. They're pretty memorable.

Hyeongjun: The moment of watching the music video of our debut song with the members right before our debut. It was so great because I knew all the hard work we put into it.

Taeyoung: I remember when I went home and told my parents the news that I was going to debut with the group. It's my happiest memory.

MTV News: In the spirit of your single "Break All The Rules," what are some rules you've broken?

Allen: There's a rule that nobody is allowed to eat in the vocal practice room. I have eaten a tiny energy bar very secretly.

Jungmo: We promised to go to bed at 2 o'clock [in the morning] in the dormitory, but we have reneged. I also promised my vocal teacher not to eat late night snacks for dinner, but I ate ramen and sausages.

Woobin: I am always late in the morning, so I feel sorry for the members.

Wonjin: One of the rules of our dorm is not to disturb anyone who is sleeping, but when I see the members sleeping they're so cute that I play pranks without even realizing it.

Hyeongjun: When I talk to the members, sometimes I speak informally.

Taeyoung: When I was in elementary school, I went up to the rooftop on the ladder behind the school building and played, and I remember the school removed the ladder afterwards.

Seongmin: It is a little childish, but I used to play pranks on Wonjin. I'd spray water [on him] and hide his cell phone.

MTV News: A lot of trainees work hard with one goal in mind: to debut. Now that you've debuted, what are some new goals you've each been setting for yourselves?

Serim: My first goal is to receive the Rookie of the Year award.

Allen: My goal is to introduce Cravity to many other people around the world. I hope to become a well-known, well-respected artist, and also hope that our music could give a lot of energy and happiness to the people who listen to it.

Jungmo: First of all, I cannot wait to meet our fans. I want to have a concert, a fan signing event, travel with the members and do a reality show… I want to [chart] on Billboard.

Woobin: We want to show many people our hard work, which we have been practicing a lot for and putting our effort into so far. I am curious about the public's reaction.

Hyeongjun: I want to let the world know the four letters ["크래비티"] of Cravity.

Taeyoung: Starting with meeting the members, my goal is to meet good people who will be with me for the rest of my life.It seems everyone's on TikTok these days—including several K-pop idols! With the current situation making live events impossible for now, celebrities have taken to uploading more content on social media in order to interact with their fans. If you find yourself missing your faves a bit more than usual, hit the Follow button and find yourself entertained by their antics on this crazy-fun platform. From dance challenges, to skits, to releasing clips of their music (which you can then use for your own TikTok posts!), there's a little bit of everything for us to enjoy.In the fast changing K-pop industry, BoA has stood the test of time. 



Including her latest EP “Starry Night” in December and her debut at age 13 with “ID; Peace B” in 2000, she has sold millions of records and become a household name in South Korea. 



And then there was “No. 1.” Around two years into her career, she released her second studio album with the track on her home turf after her million-seller Japanese debut album “Listen to My Heart” topped the Oricon chart. 



It was a perfect homecoming that propelled her to nationwide stardom, at a time when the Seoul-Tokyo relations were improving as the 2002 World Cup took place in both countries in the same year.



“‘No.1’ is a song that gifted me with the most meaningful and happiest moment of my career so far,” BoA told The Korea Herald. 



With the song, she became the youngest to win the grand prize of SBS Gayo Daejeon, a music awards show that aired on SBS until 2016 which has now become an annual televised music show.



“I often sing ‘No. 1’ as the last song at my shows, which is met with the loudest screams from my fans. It’s a fan favorite,” she added.



Norwegian songwriter and producer Sigurd Rosnes, who goes by “Ziggy,” recalls the time he made the song nearly two decades ago when the capital-P pop sound, spearheaded by the likes of Britney Spears, dominated the world.





“I’d programmed the drums and I knew that I wanted to write kind of an uplifting happy thing – something that would make you feel good,” Rosnes said.



Though he normally sings gibberish to fill in the melody, this time he had already come up with the phrase “You’re still my number one” -- the famous line for the chorus that many Koreans can still sing along off by heart.



“This was when Max Martin started out doing his stuff with Britney. Not the chorus, but I felt like the verse had a similar vibe to it,” he explained.



Originally, “No. 1” was not the lead track, according to Jason Park, a former S.M. Entertainment employee who worked at the overseas business team at the time. Rather, it was just one of many tracks on “hundreds of demo CDs” that ended up in the hands of her label before gaining favorability from staff and later executive producer Lee Soo-man, who was very much into Max Martin at that time. 



The lead single was originally slated to be a song by the label’s in-house composer Yoo Young-jin, which meant that someone had to buck the hierarchy to clear the spot for what would become one of BoA’s biggest hits.



“I was also working as producer Lee’s driver at that time and got a chance to play the song in the car, explaining to him that this song from our business trip to Sweden was a better choice,” Park said. 



BoA’s second studio album “No. 1” went on to sell over 500,000 copies, becoming one of the best-selling records of the year in Korea, according to the Recording Industry Association of Korea.



Music critic Lim Jin-mo believes her success in Japan in the early 2000s, when it was an unlikely achievement for a South Korean act, opened many doors for pop acts from her country in the second largest music market in the world before the K-pop industry turned its attention to the US.



“BoA acted as a figurehead for breakthroughs in Japan for South Korean acts, a country with a bigger and more developed music industry, becoming a pivotal figure in K-pop’s history,” he said.



Tamar Herman, a K-pop correspondent for Billboard, agrees.



“As a result, the Japanese music market became more familiar with Korean artistry and a major market for just about every other K-pop act that followed.” 



As fate would have it, BoA released “Only One” in 2012, her seventh Korean language studio album with a self-written lead single of the same title.





The melodious mid-tempo track was a departure from her signature dance-pop persona, but like “No. 1,” it wasn’t initially intended to front an album until executive producer Lee Soo-man had a change of heart.



And through songs like ‘CAMO’ and ‘Woman’ in her recent years, BoA has continued to reinvent herself, as well getting more involved in the creative process.



“Two decades in, and her most recent releases show a whole new side to her than she’s ever depicted before, putting both her identity as an individual, not just a pop star and as a woman in the spotlight,” Herman added.

That’s easier said than done right now, but had you made it down to The O2 Arena in a pre-lockdown London at the end of February, you’d have had the ultimate introduction to the genre: a night with the aptly named K-pop supergroup, SuperM.

Despite having only debuted late last year with a five-track “mini album” (that also featured two additional instrumentals), SuperM managed to pack the 20,000-person capacity arena with feverish fans, each clutching the hefty light sticks that are considered essential armoury for K-pop concerts, which would later illuminate the venue in a synchronised sea of LED allegiance. How do you land a gig at the UK’s second-largest indoor arena with only five songs to entice potential ticket purchasers with?

Well, its seven members have already been in the limelight for some time now, rising to fame in other boy bands managed their record label, SM Entertainment, who put them together with the aim of them becoming “the Avengers of K-pop”. Now 26, Taemin has been a part of Shinee since the tender age of 14; Baekhyun and Kai have been performing as part of Exo for almost a decade; Taeyong and Mark debuted with NCT in 2016; and Ten and Lucas have been a part of WayV since 2018. You can tell which band member pulled in which fans by analysing their light sticks: slime-green cubes for NCT’s Taeyong and Mark, turquoise crystals for Shinee’s Taemin, white hexagons for Exo’s Baekhyun and Kai and a green V for WayV’s Ten and Lucas, while SuperM’s own light stick is bright pink.

“I definitely never predicted that K-pop would become so loved by so many all over the world,” says 27-year-old Baekhyun backstage before the show. For many of the band’s members, this is their first time performing in London and their excitement is palpable, as they sing and joke around between themselves before sitting down to be interviewed. “I’m really thankful for all the artists and groups that worked hard and eventually paved the way for the genre to be where it is today, especially looking at how many fans there are globally and how open people are to different genres and cultures,” Baekhyun continues. “That in turn pushes us to work even harder.” What does hard work look like to SuperM? “Well, we practice hard… all night long, until we all get the choreography down.”

It may sound gruelling, but their rehearsal schedule sure pays off. On stage, SuperM attack their dance routines with military precision, with footwork so intricate that it’s a miracle they have time to catch their breath, let alone sing. By the end of the show, many of them look as though they’ve just run in from a sudden downpour, dripping in sweat and panting for air in between statements of gratitude towards the crowd. Just as well, then, that they’d saved their most intense song, “Jopping”, for last, a track that swells rock, pop, house and hip-hop influences around the catchy hook of “Cause when we jumping and popping, we jopping.” It’s the kind of song that wouldn’t sound too out of place on a superhero film soundtrack and, to be honest, the band members could probably scrub up to be pretty decent superheroes themselves – no doubt doing their own stunts as well.

It’s clear to see that SuperM are having the time of their lives, as seven guys in their twenties travelling the world, reaping the rewards of years of practice and dedication. The best part is that, despite being put together by their record label, the members genuinely seem to get on with each other. “It’s our first time touring together as SuperM and the bond has gotten a lot stronger between us as we’ve spent time together,” explains Baekhyun, who, as the group’s leader, is the most vocal. “On a regular day, we like to eat together or, if we have time, go out and shop together.” It turns out that the band had even found time to squeeze in a quick shopping trip around London before their show and, as Mark lets the audience know during the show, Taeyong went on a big splurge at Dover Street Market.

If you've already noticed the band's impeccable sense of style (and you should have; at any given time they each look as though they could be walking down the runway at fashion week), you're probably wondering what kinds of clothes SuperM like to fill their shopping bags with. Taeyong likes to keep things classic, anchoring his outfits with a black base. “Then I accessorise more on the jewellery side,” he explains. The bleach-blond-haired Taemin takes a slightly different approach, tailoring his looks to his surroundings. “When I travel, I tend to have a certain concept or image in mind for that particular city or region I’m travelling to,” he describes of his styling technique. “Sometimes I’ll dress up my outfits a bit more if I feel like it matches my perception of that city or the atmosphere, or maybe put on a coat, or maybe go all black.” Baekhyun leans more towards streetwear, favouring brands such as Supreme, but when it comes to selecting pieces he takes a similar approach to Kai, who depends on reliable basics. “I think sticking to nice basics is key, so you don’t look so over-the-top and look comfortable,” he says. As for Mark, Lucas and Ten, they prioritise comfort over anything else. “I usually think of all the clothes that I can dance in,” explains Lucas. “I think the base of whatever I wear comes from dancing.”

On the way home from their blockbuster show at The O2, I feel as though I'm coming down from a state of giddy delirium, riding a residual high from the non-stop energy that consumed the arena for the past two hours. I can only imagine how SuperM must feel, having performed the show in Paris and across the US in the weeks prior. There's been much said about the demanding nature of the K-pop industry and the impact it has on its stars. Although the band are all in high spirits, even from the eye of a spectator it looks exhausting. “We’re just like everyone else, we like to unwind the same way everyone does,” says Baekhyun when I ask how they find time to de-stress within their schedules. “Some of us like playing games, or some of us will go to the spa to relax.” Taemin cheekily chips in that some of the band members have also recently begun hitting the gym to let off some steam. “Yes, we’ve been working out hard,” agrees Baekhyun. This clearly tickles Mark, who lets out a loud laugh, in turn sparking a wave of what I assume is playful banter among the group.

And that's the beauty of K-pop, the fact that, even if there's a language barrier, you can still understand the heart and meaning behind a sentiment. In the past few years, the genre has done a phenomenal job of bridging cultures and uniting fans all over the world.

SuperM are in lockdown right now, but they've been live-streaming gigs online for their fans, complete with revised choreography and AR effects, and took part in Lady Gaga's “One World: Together At Home” concert last week. At times like these, their power to connect audiences globally feels more significant than ever. When all this is over, the Avengers of K-pop will assemble, ready for world domination, but, for now, turn up the music and get jopping in your living room. It's a guaranteed mood booster, promise.

The game-changers from a decade of K-pop

Kai from EXO is the world’s best-dressed K-pop star

Seeing Blackpink live is proof K-pop is the futureBTS (also known as the Bangtan Boys) is one of the world’s most successful bands. They’ve already matched The Beatles’ record of three No. 1 albums in a single year on the Billboard 200. Their catchy songs have been streamed over 8 billion times on Spotify, and their slick videos have been watched over 6 billion times on YouTube in the past year alone—that’s 11 times more than the Jonas Brothers. BTS’ latest album, “Map of the Soul: 7,” had the biggest U.S. release of any band so far in 2020. And their latest U.S. tour even outsold Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande on StubHub. But despite their global success, BTS gets limited airplay on American radio. The radio stations tracked by MRC Data/Nielsen Music have only played BTS 83,000 times in the past year. By comparison, Harry Styles has gotten three times as many spins, Taylor Swift 18 times more, and Post Malone 27 times more. By ignoring such a massively successful band, specifically one that has a global following, radio is selling its listeners short. BTS also gets limited airplay on iHeartMedia, the country’s largest radio network with more than 850 stations. Two of the largest stations, Los Angeles’ KIIS-FM and New York’s Z100, only played BTS’ recent single “ON” once on release day, and hadn’t again as of March 30, according to music analytics tool Soundcharts. NowThis sought to better understand why, but iHeartMedia did not respond to a request for comment by time of publishing. “For a certain type of artist that wants to have that stupid big hit ... FM radio is still kind of the kingmaker.” These two radio stations have been a bit more supportive of other BTS singles in the past — KIIS-FM and Z100 played “Boy With Luv” featuring Halsey over 350 and 100 times, respectively. However, BTS’ numbers pale in comparison to other top 40 hits. KIIS-FM and Z100 had played Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now” almost 1,300 and 1,800 times as of March 30. Even so, BTS performed at iHeartMedia’s Jingle Ball tour last year. “I'd be asking the question, why would you do performances for someone who doesn't support you?” said Phil Guerini, VP of music strategy for Disney Channels Worldwide and GM of the Radio Disney Network, which has played BTS’ songs almost 10,000 times since October 2017. Artists often perform at radio shows or multi-headlined promotional concerts to boost their profiles.

Radio still matters in 2020 because, whether it is played in the car or streamed online, it continues to have a massive audience. 244.5 million Americans aged 18 or over still listen to radio each month, according to Nielsen data. That’s a greater number of users than any other device, including smartphones. “For a certain type of artist that wants to have that stupid big hit, that hit that grandma knows, that hit that your dentist knows, that hit that everyone in the world knows, FM radio is still kind of the kingmaker,” explained Bill Werde, the former editorial director of Billboard and the director of the Bandier Program at Syracuse University's Newhouse School. Radio also remains surprisingly popular among teens: 93% of 12-17 year olds still listen to radio. Why Radio Is Afraid to Play BTS The radio industry wants to keep listeners tuned in. “[People] think radio is about playing new music, and it's not. Radio is about maintaining an audience. That's how they get paid ... If a radio station isn't adding a song, it's because they believe that it's going to cause people to turn the station,” Werde said. For that reason, many radio stations don’t take risks with new acts. "They don't really want to play songs that people haven't heard yet, unless there's just an enormous amount of buzz around a specific single.” "I have had people [in the industry] say they don't understand K-pop. They don't understand why BTS is so big. They just don't get it.” The industry often fears that non-English songs will lead listeners to tune out. “A radio programmer wants songs that the listener is going to sing along or rap along with,” said Chris Molanphy, a chart analyst, pop critic, and host of the Slate podcast “Hit Parade.” “They want engagement from the listener. Call it xenophobia, that's certainly part of it. But when you look at the scant history of non-English language hits over the years, the fact that BTS would be facing this challenge is not all that surprising.” The radio industry wants to keep listeners tuned in. “[People] think radio is about playing new music, and it's not. Radio is about maintaining an audience. That's how they get paid ... If a radio station isn't adding a song, it's because they believe that it's going to cause people to turn the station,” Werde said. For that reason, many radio stations don’t take risks with new acts. "They don't really want to play songs that people haven't heard yet, unless there's just an enormous amount of buzz around a specific single.”The industry often fears that non-English songs will lead listeners to tune out. “A radio programmer wants songs that the listener is going to sing along or rap along with,” said Chris Molanphy, a chart analyst, pop critic, and host of the Slate podcast “Hit Parade.” “They want engagement from the listener.

Not every program director is dismissive of non-English songs. Outliers around the country include Beth Cruise in Kansas. As program director at 105.9 KISS-FM, she has been playing “ON” around 35 times per week, about half as often as Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now.” Cruise said that in the last few months, "I have had people [in the industry] say they don't understand K-pop. They don't understand why BTS is so big. They just don't get it.” “It's going to take an exceptional hit, a quite literally exceptional hit, to get BTS over that language barrier at radio.” Radio is also concerned that music popular with teen audiences will make older listeners tune out. “Pop radio has always been conflicted about teen acts,” explained Sean Ross, VP of music and programming at Edison Research and author of the Why Radio Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Play BTS Radio programmers should not be afraid to play global hits with non-English lyrics. American listeners do enjoy such global hits when introduced to them. Consider “Despacito,” “Gangnam Style,” and “Macarena,” all of which were radio hits in their respective years. Though few and far between, these examples indicate that Americans can rally around a non-English song. There’s even social science to back this up. Study after study shows that consumers love a Radio is also concerned that music popular with teen audiences will make older listeners tune out. “Pop radio has always been conflicted about teen acts,” explained Sean Ross, VP of music and programming at Edison Research and author of the Ross On Radio newsletter . “Some groups become big and undeniable enough to be New Kids on the Block or Backstreet Boys. Other times, program directors draw a line in the sandbox. They’d rather deal with Justin Timberlake, or Selena Gomez, or Miley Cyrus, or Liam Payne when they grow up and start making more adult songs.” Even Justin Bieber didn’t reach No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 National Airplay chart until 2015’s “What Do You Mean?” “This may surprise people who think of top 40 radio as something that is listened to primarily by teenagers ... but your average top 40 radio programmer does not want to alienate people over the age of, say, 16 or 18 or 20,” said Molanphy.Radio programmers should not be afraid to play global hits with non-English lyrics.

Molanphy cautioned, “It's going to take an exceptional hit, a quite literally exceptional hit, to get BTS over that language barrier at radio.” Werde predicted, “What you will see are groundswell numbers coming from streaming that become so big that radio starts to take chances.”

Radio programmers could be missing out on opportunities to draw new listeners if they overlook bands with large fanbases. BTS’ music is popular not only with teens, but also with a general audience. Their songs are about complex issues such as depression, generational divides, and self-love. Their most recent albums explore psychological topics such as the persona (the face we show the world) and the shadow (the face we try to hide). Their genre-defying music is not just K-pop but also EDM, hip-pop, and R&B. “I think it’s less and less meaningful to put music into genres now,” BTS band member Suga said at the GRAMMYs in February. “The genre is BTS,” added band members V, Jungkook, and J-Hope. So, to dismiss BTS as teen pop is unfair. While the BTS members were mostly teenagers when they debuted, they are all 20-somethings now — and their fans (who are known as ARMY) have grown with them. In fact, BTS fans say the most common misconception about ARMY is that they are “screaming teenage fangirls,” when in fact, they are much more diverse, including all races, genders, and ages. Ultimately, radio’s beliefs about American listeners may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If radio rarely plays non-English global hits, listeners won’t be aware of those songs. But if radio does take that chance, listeners may begin to appreciate such music, too. BTS’ songs are undeniably catchy, as fans have made clear. There’s plenty to enjoy even without a thorough understanding of the mostly Korean lyrics.Yeji: "Itzy and Midzy are like good friends who give each other strength when life gets tough, and the courage to continue forward! I want to tell Midzy that we’re receiving and learning positive energy from how they’re always rooting for us below the stage, and likewise, that we also want to become artists who always root for them as well."

Lia: "Midzy is like a roof. Just like how five tall pillars mean nothing when there’s no roof to hold them together and provide protection, we need Midzy for Itzy to be complete. We, as Itzy, will do our best to provide good support as pillars so that the roof doesn’t fall through. I learned a lot about love and warmth from Midzy. I want to tell them how beautiful, precious, and lovable they are!"

Ryujin: "They’re like friends, and because I’m so grateful for the amount of love Midzy gives us, I always wonder how to reciprocate that love back to them. I’m thankful that Midzy has made me into a person who thinks about how to return love, and although I say this often, I want them to know they’re all so cool and beautiful just as they are."

Chaeryeong: "I want to say Itzy and Midzy are each other’s joy! We’ve learned from Midzy how to love and root for someone, and how to express that love and support. I think we can pass on how to dance to Midzy!"

Yuna: "I think Itzy and Midzy exist to make every moment of each other’s lives special! Midzy always makes us feel comforted, and I get a great sense of security from their support. I want to thank Midzy for always being there for us, and I want them to know how much we love them!"Members of K-pop group Golden Child, one of seven competing in Road to Kingdom, a reality-TV contest starting this week for boy bands still looking for their big breakthrough. Photo: HandoutBTS may not be promoting their 2019 album Map of the Soul: Persona any longer, but fans of the Korean septet are still buying and listening to the project non-stop, or so it would seem based on the title’s continued performance on Billboard’s World Albums chart. This frame, the set lands at No. 6 in its fifty-second spin on the list, making it the latest K-pop release to spend at least a full year somewhere on the tally.

Map of the Soul: Persona is now just the sixth Korean-language album to occupy space on the World Albums chart for a year, and unsurprisingly (to those who have been paying attention to both the band’s rise and the weekly ranking), all of those successful projects come from the same group.

BTS remains the only Korean act, solo or band, to keep a full-length on the World Albums chart for at least 52 frames, and they have several releases in their back catalog that have spent many more turns on the tally.

The longest-charting Korean-language release in the history of the World Albums chart is BTS’s Love Yourself: Tear, which has now racked up 89 turns on the tally. Just a few frames behind that longstanding win come their other two titles from that three-part series, Love Yourself: Answer and Love Yourself: Her. Those releases have now lived on the tally for 85 and 83 weeks, respectively.

BTS’s 2017 drop You Never Walk Alone has now accrued 63 turns on the World Albums chart, and just a few frames ahead of Map of the Soul: 7 is Face Yourself. That studio effort has now racked up 58 weeks on the ranking.

So far, no other Korean musicians have been able to keep a title on the World Albums ranking for 40 weeks or more, so BTS doesn’t face any real competition at this point in regards to anybody matching their success. A small number of well-known figures, such as NCT 127 and Exo, have been lucky enough to see releases spend half a year on the list, and they may very well improve their performance with future releases, but for the moment, BTS is truly in a league of their own.While in Seoul recently, I couldn't stop staring at people's nails. Everyone I met seemed more fun looks than the next. One of my friends had a floral and checkered nail art. Another had long navy acrylics with silver embellishments.

"Nail trends in Korea tend to be simpler and cuter in style rather than flashy and spectacular," says Sunny, the owner of Sunkuku Nail Art Studio, in Seoul's Hapjeong neighborhood. People often pick colors to match the season and decorate their nails with crystals, she adds. Although shorter nails are generally preferred, Sunny notes her clients seek out her private studio for nail extensions.

Sumi Lee, who owns SSum Art Studio in Seoul's Gangnam area, is also known for her talon-like creations. K-pop stars like KARD's Jiwoo and Jamie Park often stop by her studio to take their nail shapes beyond the usual choices: round or square.

One of my favorite stops of the trip had to be Unistella, though. Here, I met up with Park Eunkyung, who is at the helm of not only Korea's nail trends but the world's. Instagram has helped put her masterpieces on a global stage. She graced my nails with some of the top-requested looks, like watercolor and chunky glitter.

All three Seoul-based nail artists shared the top nail trends in Korea. Turns out, most are inspired by familiar things: an emoji, a shoe, a song, a beauty product, and a natural phenomenon. May these exciting nail art ideas from across the world inspire your next manicure — at home or otherwise.

After her short-lived career in a disbanded eleven-member girl group, the artist went on to debut as a successful solo artist under MNH Entertainment. Her hits include the singles “Gotta Go”, “Rollercoaster”, with her best-selling album being “Offset”.

On 20th April, she teased about the pre-release for her new single “Stay Tonight”.

Her fans did not take it well.

Chung Ha was immediately called out for “appropriating” our (Indian) culture.

In the teasers, she is seen wearing a “maang tikka /nethi chutti” (traditional Indian headpiece). Though some Twitterati claimed that she is also seen wearing a bindi in the teaser (traditional Indian mark on a woman’s forehead), it is to be noted that this is confused with a part of the headpiece hanging over her forehead. But again, is the bindi and the headpiece connected? Not clear.

Both as an Indian and a Hindu, I have an unpopular opinion: The K-Pop community should stop blaming Chung Ha.

I have so many points to put forward as to why this is not as adverse as cultural appropriation which is typically made on a racial basis.

The Intention Is What Matters:

One of the main factor that draws the fine line between “cultural appreciation” and “cultural appropriation” is the intent. To be more specific, if Chung Ha had dressed up under any of the following factors:
• None Has a history of racism towards India
• None Worn it inappropriately (eg. worn over body parts not supposed to be worn over)

Only then, we can rightfully take offence.

But giving a good look at the picture, it is obvious that the she had modelled with no ill-intentions. Chung Ha doesn’t seem to have a racist past, thus it is clear that she is not taking advantage of our traditional jewellery. Also, she has worn the headpiece as it is supposed to be worn (placed properly over the head).

Her pictures are not explicit in any way. To claim that she had posed with the jewellery in a vulgar way is also very careless. In addition to this, the jewellery itself looks nowhere close to any traditional Indian headpieces, since the latter tend to have more sophisticated and native designs. My guess is that the basic structure of the headpiece is what they built Chung Ha’s piece on.

Celebrities Have Always Done This:

It is old news that celebrities from around the world have always been taking inspiration from our culture. This is not only applicable to fashion, but also their major works like music.

One of the prominent examples for this is MO who featured in Major Lazer’s and DJ Snake’s music video “Lean On”. Here, the setting is in an Indian palace and her clothes are partly inspired by Indian traditional wear.

Also, Selena Gomez’s “Come & Get It” from her album “Stars Dance” has Bhangra music as a part of its composition. The song is about patiently waiting and being there for her lover. Nothing to do with “praising India” here.

With the internet widely available, we are in the peak of globalization. Bluntly stating, adopting other cultures purely for the aesthetic sense is reality now. As long as our intentions are good – honestly, it doesn’t matter. The world is integrating into one large village and constantly seeking out to “safeguard” our culture is totally impossible.

Not that I’m not sympathetic with the ones offended either. I get that you are upset that our culture has been used for profits without owing it to the Indians. It is a traditional jewellery used in weddings with a significant amount of religious value to it.

Twitter serves as an amazing platform to open up fair discussions on the way we treat different communities. There are a good number of people who want talk about what is right and what is not in a civilized manner. As one user said, people should be educated – not cancelled. Her stylists are ignorant in respecting values and ethics. So all we can do is teach, instead of shoving hatred on their face.

To peacefully resolve all this, admins of major fan accounts of Chung Ha took it upon themselves to ensure that the issue is communicated with her agency in a more formal and organized manner. This would ensure clear and concise communication.

Below, we can see that the admins are working hard to create formal email templates. A bunch of similar emails would help MNH Entertainment keep track of the large number of complaints and take the issue seriously.

I hope we become more tolerant and come to appreciate what other communities have adopted from ours. I also hope we all, irrespective of our different ethnicities become a little more wise in every move we make towards globalizing our actions and wardrobes.K-pop and its never-ending rise is unsurmountable even for non-fans. The entertainment industry has watched the music genre takeover award seasons and break records with quick succession. A huge part of BTS’ influence is fans and even among the fans, there are those who ARMYs, BLINKs, Exo-Ls and other fans look up to amplify their voices. These chosen representatives (upon approval of the very involved fandoms) are K-pop influencers. Desi K-pop influencers are few but they’re hella active and just as involved when it comes to their favourite music. I caught up with a superfan and one particular stand-up comedian, Supriya Joshi aka Supaarwoman to ask all our K-pop-related questions.

Indian ARMYs already know Supriya Joshi and comedy fans already know the Supaarwoman moniker. She makes quite a powerful influencer, well, everyone does want to know what’s on her Spotify playlist! Here are questions you’ve had starting from K-pop terms normies won’t understand to quarantine routines in the face of coronavirus concerns:

Some context: While BTS, the global phenomenon started breaking records years ago, the world is populated by people who just don’t get the idea of getting into Korean music or artists. We got Supaarwoman unpacking some terms for new or non-fans, stuff fans are bored of hearing and some (read: the only!) helpful clap-backs. She is one of the best comedians in the country after all, you're learning from the expert here.

What are the things Indian K-pop fans are fed-up of hearing?
• You understand Korean?/How can you understand what they are saying? (I mean, subtitles exist for a reason!)
• They all look the same! (No, you're just racist)
• Lol you listen to these Chinese boys (Once again, you're racist)
• XYZ group is gay!!!! (They could be, how does it matter? If you're using someone’s sexuality as a slur, then you're a homophobe who needs help)

Can you breakdown down K-pop terms that non-K-pop fans don't understand?
• Bias: Your favourite member of a group. Someone you're biased towards
• Bias wrecker: A member who you start liking, the member wrecks your bias
• Anti: A person who is an "anti-fan" of the group
• Comeback/Cb: When a group releases new music, it's called a comeback
• Fan chant: These are specific words/chants that fans scream out at specific intervals during a group's song
• Borahae: This is specific only for BTS and their fans (called ARMYs). BTS member Kim Taehyung/V coined the phrase ‘Borahae’ to mean a feeling that goes beyond love. In English, it translates to ‘I Purple You’

If you think these terms read cute, you should hear K-pop idols say them. It’s absolutely adorable you’ll almost want to learn the language. BTW you can do it now that BTS is out there giving out Korean language lessons. Remember when Parasite director Bong Joon-ho said that we just need to get over the one-inch subtitle gap and it opens up a world of quality art? Fans can do that and then some. Here’s how you can Learn Korean With BTS In New Video Series. You could come out of quarantine with language proficiency and no use for looking up lyrics every now and then.

Speaking of, what's the quintessential K-pop fan's lockdown routine, (since idols are always serving material on social media)?

We’re always streaming our favourites and discovering more K-pop music, be it through our Daily Mixes on Spotify or K-pop playlists like K-pop wave, K-pop Daebak, Korean OSTs on the platform. Apart from streaming music, we watch their music videos, tweet to them that we miss them and hope they are doing well, we wait for them to hopefully do a live stream so we can watch them, and we also connect with fellow fans on twitter and share memes.

Best part about this? Fans worldwide get equal love from their favourite idols, they don't need to be in crowded stadiums especially now that BTS' tour has been postponed indefinitely. The hype is real with desimys as it just takes some new music to make their day 10x better-

Have you tried any K-pop dance routines during the COVID-19 quarantine? Do you have any tips?

I have tried learning the dances of Super Junior's Sorry and BTS' Fake Love and I think I look like a flailing salmon when I do. I think it's best to let the experts do the dancing, while us mere mortals can just watch and enjoy their performances.

Trying to sing and dance along to K-pop isn’t the only thing fans are busing themselves with. K-pop fans are on the receiving end of some generalisations as many callout fandoms for aggressive fangirling. Placing the spotlight on ARMYs, BLINKs, Exo-Ls and every other group out there with countless twitter accounts (with stolen images) dedicated to boosting topics. Let’s talk about the right to stan and its violations that range from deafening squeals to literally sending death threats. It's not all finger-hearts and purple love. I started a dialogue about this here-

Geekly Rant: Fights, Suicides And Squealing. Are K-pop Stans This Scary?

But Supaarwoman has an insider’s perspective on it and it’s both strong and beautiful-

What's it like engaging with ARMYs on the internet as an influencer. Does it ever get overwhelming or tricky, the sheer number of fans, trending hashtags?

What I love about being an ARMY is that in this fandom, I am as much of a fan as anyone else. Within the fandom, I am not an influencer. I am just a person who loves BTS for their music and their message. And while the fandom is huge and can be overwhelming, you also have to see the incredible work that it does. Recently, when BTS' Seoul concerts got cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the ARMYs who received a refund for their tickets donated their money to COVID-19 vaccine research. They regularly do fundraisers around members' birthdays, and even, in general, have a spirit of philanthropy, because that is also a message BTS propagates. It's really wholesome to see.

What do you think of BTS' central messaging "Love yourself", coming from such pretty boys? How are fans learning to love themselves?

BTS' message about loving yourself has never been about beauty - it's about loving yourself, speaking your truth, taking a stand and accepting who you are, no matter what. It's never been about superficial things. Their message of self-love is to look inwards - to love yourself and to be yourself. During their debut, BTS went through a lot of hardships - they are literally a rags to riches story. They worked hard, they believed in themselves and they made it because their fans, the ARMYs saw themselves in their struggle. A great example of this is BTS' leader Kim Namjoon's UNICEF speech in 2018, where he urged everyone to "Speak Yourself" - speak your truth. BTS' music provides a lot of healing to the ARMYs. It helps soothes our fears and anxieties because it feels like the person we are listening to are going through the same hardships as us, and we seem to be emerging out of them together.

K-pop and Korean movies are currently a hot topic especially since 2019’s award season. After Bong Joon-Ho accepted his Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language and dropped a bomb speech, he did a red carpet interview. In the interview, he spoke about Korean artist and went on to talk about the influence of BTS as they are the biggest thing in global pop at the moment after 'Boy with Luv's success. He gushed over the band and BTS Had the Cutest Response To It. However, representation is an important aspect the fandom often talks about.

Why BTS’ Historic MTV VMAs Win In New K-pop Category Is Controversial AF!

What are your thoughts on Kpop getting separate award categories in spite of forming a large chunk of mainstream music globally?

The numbers really speak for themselves. More and more people are listening to K-Pop every day, so why does it deserve a separate category? Just because it is spoken in a different language? English isn't the only language in the world, and with the Hallyu wave taking over the world, it just feels wrong to not have K-Pop groups nominated in regular categories.

So if you’re looking for the motivation to get up, move, and sweat a little, why not try fun dance workouts?

• “Mic Drop” by BTS, “Boombayah” by BLACKPINK, “Bang Bang Bang” by BIGBANGFour Korean musical acts—BTS, SuperM, Monsta X and NCT 127—have all reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the U.S. with at least one project, with two doing so for the first time just this year.

Now the race is on to see which soloist or group from South Korea can become the fifth, making history the minute they place an album or EP somewhere between Nos. 1 and 10 on the chart.

But who will it be? There are a number of artists who have been working hard at becoming the next breakout stars in the States, and it may be any one of the names mentioned below.

It would appear that Exo could be the next K-pop group to reach the highest tier on the Billboard 200, as they are the act that has come the closest to the region without ever breaking in, though it’s tough to say if they will actually end up becoming the latest lucky name to make history. The band saw their album Don't Mess Up My Tempo peak at No. 23 in 2018, an impressive placement for the time. That seemed to suggest they were headed for major things, but their newer release, 2019’s Obsession, somehow only rose as high as No. 182.

Exo probably has another collection coming this year, and many will be watching closely to see where it lands.

Korean quartet Blackpink have also come relatively close to the Billboard 200’s top 10 in the past, and chances are whenever they share a new collection it will perform even better. Their 2019 EP Kill This Love managed to peak at No. 24, coming in one rung below Exo’s highest placement.

Since then, Blackpink has gained plenty of fans, and if they release an album as opposed to an EP (their last effort only featured five songs), they may gain ground thanks to an increase in streams.

A Member Of BTS On Their Own

In addition to their work with BTS, who have now landed four chart-toppers and another top 10 title, two members of the septet have not only reached the Billboard 200 on their own, but broken into the top 40 with solo releases. Both RM and J-Hope have scored successful albums, as their projects under their monikers, Mono and Hope World, peaked at Nos. 26 and 38, respectively.

Whenever either performer releases another full-length on their own, they may step up even higher, possibly even reaching the top 10. It’s also possible that another member of the group could present a solo endeavor next, though RM and J-Hope appear to be the most likely candidates for this honor.

There don’t appear to be many other well-known K-pop acts who look ready to enter the Billboard 200’s loftiest arena with their next release, but that doesn’t mean someone who has never placed on the tally before won’t become the fifth Korean name to do so.

SuperM shocked many in the U.S. music industry last year when they started their first EP together, a self-titled effort, at No. 1 on the chart, becoming just the second Korean musical act to rule the roost. It’s unlikely, but possible that another big surprise is in the works.Supernova’s leader and vocalist Jung Yun-hak is the first K-Pop idol to test positive for COVID-19.

After his return from Japan where he was working as a producer for audition programe ‘G-EGG’, the singer and actor reportedly visited a special testing centre in Seocho District after showing symptoms of the virus.

On Friday, the band confirmed media reports on its official Japanese website, revealing that he got tested last Tuesday and is undergoing treatment in a Seoul hospital.

Following his diagnosis, his manager and other staff members underwent testing and results were negative.

A member of Supernova since 2007, Jung, who has ventured into musicals and acting and is mainly active in Japan, is the only South Korean entertainer to have been affected by the COVID-19 so far.

Last week, JYJ’s Kim Jaejoong pulled an April fool’s prank in a now-deleted Instagram post by revealing that he contracted the virus and was hospitalised. The singer clarified in a caption that the post was in no way a joke but an effort to raise awareness and for people to take care of themselves.

Yuehua Entertainment’s two staff members were recently diagnosed with the coronavirus. As a result, members of K-Pop girl group Everglow were tested and it was all negative as of Friday. All their schedules have been cancelled for their safety and have entered two weeks of quarantine.

Because Everglow member Sihyun works alongside Kim Min-kyu and The Boyz’s Juyeon on SBS MTV’s ‘The Show’ as co-hosts, the K-Pop idols as well its staff members were advised to receive testing as precautionary measures. Cre.ker Entertainment shared on social media that its artist Juyeon tested negative while Kim is still waiting for his results.

Chung Ha also went under self-isolation after two of her staff members tested positive for the coronavirus in March.This month, Allure is exploring all the ways South Korean music — and the idols essential to the genre — has become a source of beauty innovation and creativity around the world. When we began brainstorming this "Beauty of K-Pop" project earlier this year, we knew a trip to Seoul would be required. We made plans to send three Allure team members abroad to collaborate with Korean creatives (like photographer Jooyoung Ahn) for our covers with Jihyo of TWICE and JB of GOT7. Beauty editor Devon Abelman, visuals director Kathryne Hall, and entertainment editor Eugene Shevertalov traveled to Seoul in February before COVID-19 became an international pandemic. Then, in the week that the team spent in the city, they were able to see a shift in the mood there as cases of the virus began to rise in South Korea. And upon their return, they had a front-row seat (from their quarantine couches) to how the U.S. responded as COVID-19 cases multiplied here. The three staffers spoke with features director Jessica Cruel about their experience creating two gorgeous covers in the time of coronavirus.

When we first started planning these double K-pop covers, what were you most excited about?

Eugene Shevertalov: I was excited about working with PR reps in Korea and seeing how the process was different from that in the U.S., which it was. It was challenging but exciting to find the middle ground. Being able to be there to see it come together and meet everyone involved was probably the best part.

Kathryne Hall: I was excited to work with a great photographer in South Korea that I would not normally get to commission for a shoot and the opportunity to travel to Seoul. Also, we thought K-pop stars would be fun to work with — and we were right about that!

Devon Abelman: In K-pop, beauty is presented in such a mystical way, which has inspired me over the years. I was excited to share that with Allure readers. I also looked forward to understanding JB and Jihyo on different levels. I typically get to do 15-minute interviews with groups backstage while they’re on tour, so the thought of having the time to get to know them and share their stories in a new way thrilled me.

When you arrived in Seoul, did you see the effects of COVID-19?

Devon: I went a week before everyone else, and didn't really feel any difference [from the other times I've travelled to Korea]. Although my friend who lives there would point out the differences. We went to this one neighborhood that's mostly university students, and she said usually there would be people everywhere. But there was hardly anyone around. And I was like, "Oh, it's raining out, maybe that's why." She said, "No, it's because of the virus." But I was still going out with my friends, and my friends still went out to clubs and bars. They would ask me, "Oh, are you nervous?" And I was like, "I don't know, should I be?"BTS caused quite the bang over the weekend after their 24-hour "Bang Bang Con" online event featuring old concert footage and fan meetings garnered more than 50 million views. So which K-pop group should step up to the virtual mic next?

SuperM already has a livestream concert in the books with their "With You" performance during the World Health Organization and Global Citizen's star-studded One World: Together at Home concert that Lady Gaga curated this past Saturday, but their fanbase would love more.

After Blackpink reminisced on their historic Coachella 2019 debut by posting two epic throwback clips earlier this month, Lisa turned heads with her latest dance cover of QUIÑ and 6LACK’s "Mushroom Chocolate" on her personal YouTube channel Monday. Blinks would love to see the Thailand-raised K-pop singer pull off more sensual stunts with the rest of the girls in a full-on livestream show.As the Asian-American star turns 33, we look back at how this humble talent strafes musical genres and cultural borders alikeSo your part of the world has gone on coronavirus lockdown, and you’re stuck at home (thank you for doing your part to stop the spread!). At first it might sound kind of nice to not be able to go anywhere for a bit. You can finally take some time for yourself, focus on a project or two, maybe find a new hobby…but then the days stretch into weeks and you realize that when you’re stuck in one place, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do homework, work, or, well, much of anything at all — not to mention the boredom.

Luckily, music is a great way to combat monotony, and these 17 K-pop songs are chill enough for lazy days, but bright to pep up your mood. Most importantly, they’re addicting enough to have on repeat until quarantine is over — but in the meantime, you might just find them #relatable to your social distancing life!

No song is a more perfect anthem for the times than “Humph!” considering its Korean title (and catchy chorus) literally translates to “you can’t come closer.” But “Humph!” also just happens to be a great song to listen to when you’re bored at home: its youthful, bouncy vibe will brighten your mood, and it’s so infectious you’ll want to put it on repeat.

2. “What Are You Up To” — Kang Daniel

Kang Daniel waits around for someone to call in “What Are You Up To,” which is a whole mood for those of us whose social lives now consist entirely of virtual conversations. We’re not up to much these days, but we appreciate Daniel asking. Don’t forget to check out his recent comeback “2U“!

We usually associate “blue” with feeling down, but in “Blueming,” IU refurbishes the color to represent warmth and blossoming love. If boredom’s got you down, “Blueming” might just be the refresher you need!

Zico could not have picked a better year to pen “Any Song,” which he described as a song to listen to when you don’t want to think about anything. When you’re at your most bored and in need of a pick-me-up, listening to “Any Song” is bound to make you smile.

Zion.T’s jazzy style is perfect for any chill day, especially when paired with Seulgi’s sweet vocals. If you’re worried you’ll have forgotten how to interact with other humans by the time quarantine is over, the collab “Hello Tutorial” is a good way to ensure otherwise! Make sure you don’t miss the equally cute MV:

Leave it to Stray Kids to put a smile on your face: “Awkward Silence” delivers a silly yet heartfelt message about laughing away your awkward moments — and while thankfully we have fewer of those now that social interaction is limited, the song is a good reminder to be comfortable with yourself, which is something we all have to do when we’re spending more time with ourselves! Kick back and enjoy:

“Gotta Go” is one of the more exciting and sexy songs on this list, and not without reason: listen to Chungha’s hit and try to remember what it was like actually having places to go to! Haha… ha.

A simple household transforms into a boundless universe in the MV for “Serendipity,” and the song likewise encapsulates the feeling of seeing the world around you with new eyes. It’s simple and refreshing, and bound to give you a new perspective on your day, even from the confines of your home.

Wonder Girls’s reggae-infused hit should be on everyone’s summer playlist, but it’s also the perfect song to take out when you’re feeling bored and listless. Plus, if you’re starting to feel the isolation of being stuck at home, “Why So Lonely” will add some cool-girl chill to your social distancing. We just wish our quarantines could be as retro and fabulous as this MV!

If you find yourself craving human interaction, it’s easy to hop on over to Instagram to see what everyone else is up to in their own quarantines. But take Dean’s song, which highlights the feelings of emptiness that social media can give us, as a warning not to spend your whole day scrolling through your feed!

While it may feel like you’re cooped up inside, instead you could look at quarantine like a little staycation and allow yourself to take a break for a day or two. TWICE’s “CHILLAX” is about taking time to slow down, reflect, and relax. Plus, the song’s tropical vibes will instantly brighten your mood and put you in the vacation mindset!

If you’re finally starting to feel a little crazy from being cooped up inside, “Hold” is for you. WINNER’s latest release is the kind of unhinged, mischievous fun that we all desperately need right now; plus, watching this goofy MV over and over never fails to bring some much-needed laughs.

It’s easy for the days to all run together when you’re stuck at home for a while, and sometimes it takes a little spot of brightness to refresh your mood. Let Oh My Girl add a splash of color to your day with “Coloring Book”!

This groovy EXID track is for when the sun sets and you realize that it is, in fact, now night rather than day and that you have no idea where the day went or what you even did. Oh well, let these talented ladies croon you into the evening.

“Good Evening” is easy listening, and its sparkling chorus is seriously addicting, so it’s a great song to brighten your home-bound evenings. Actually, while you’re at it, just listen to SHINee’s whole “Story of Light” trilogy — you won’t regret it!

“Dancing King” is your last brain cell after you haven’t left the house for days on end and are definitely starting to lose it a little. But you know what? Just embrace it — and maybe get up and dance along!

2PM’s 2015 gem experienced a revival in popularity recently, and it’s so catchy that we understand why! While “let’s go to my house” isn’t something a lot of us can say these days, we can enjoy this sexy fairytale-themed music video while waiting for the day when it is:

In honor of all the dog owners out there whose pups are thrilled to spend time with them 24/7 now, listen to this sweet track from Colde and Crush while giving your pet some love!

Hey Soompiers, are you stuck at home these days? What songs are you listening to? Let us know in the comments, and stay safe, everyone.

hgordon stays up way too late on weeknights marathoning K-dramas and trying to keep up with the latest K-pop releases.Self-isolating can definitely be a drag at times, but for the sake of public health it’s best to avoid going out whenever possible. The endless days at home can get a bit monotonous, so what better way to switch it up than with a new hairstyle? (C’mon, we know you’ve been tempted to try it.) From those looking for a temporary change to those ready for a more long-term commitment, here are eight styles to give a shot while you’ve got nowhere to go anyways.

If you’re looking for a style that’s a little out-of-the-box without being too much of a commitment, then take a cue from soloist HyunA and accessorize your pigtails with multiple elastics in fun, bright colors. Matching them to your outfit is optional, but is a great way to tie the look together! They’re inexpensive, easy, and best of all – super cute!

2. Bows – the bigger, the better!

If you’ve been wearing a bun day in and day out (no judgement!) then topping off your topknot with a pretty bow is a great way to bring some brightness to the look. Plus, a big ribbon is a great way to distract from the fact that it miiiiight have been a while since your hair has been washed! BLACKPINK’s Jisoo looks stunning here with her saffron-colored bow, but feel free to pick whatever color you like.

This style worn by ITZY’s leader Yeji takes a little more technical skill, but hey – there’s plenty of time to practice! Here, her hair is pulled back into two high-sitting pigtails at the crown of her head. A piece of hair is wrapped around the elastic to conceal it, and three smaller elastics are positioned further down in the hair and then pushed up slightly to form the cute “bubble” style. The ends are left loose to give the style some swing, and some pieces are pulled down to frame her face. The result is a fresh take on a classic look!

Pantone’s Color of the Year for 2020 is Classic Blue, and it’s already become a huge hair trend with our favorite K-pop idols. If you want to take the plunge and try dyeing your hair a fun color at home, a rich blue is a great way to go – especially for those with naturally dark locks, because you don’t have to lift quite as much color out of the hair. BTS’s Jungkook is a great source of inspiration if you’re looking to get some color without committing to a whole head of blue hair.

Red Velvet’s Wendy caused quite a stir with her new look back in summer of 2019, and soon Korean salons were receiving tons of requests to recreate the style on clients. Her asymmetric dye job takes a bit more skill to get right, so it might be best to get a virtual consultation with a stylist if you can. Wendy’s look includes bright platinum ends with tiny streaks interspersed throughout the body of the hair, which peek out to add an unexpected pop. If you’re going to try this at home, be sure to bleach the hair in stages to make sure you’re not over-stripping it, and tone it afterwards for that perfect platinum look.

For (G)I-DLE’s most recent comeback, Minnie sported a set of ultra-blunt bangs that just barely reached the top of her brows. The effect is an ultra-modern, super chic take on bangs that really makes her gorgeous features pop. If you’ve already got some heavy bangs, it’s easy to trim them just that tad bit more to achieve Minnie’s look. Or, if you currently don’t have bangs but are raring to reach for the scissors, comb the front pieces of your hair forwards and snip in segments until you reach the desired length. Remember to start slow – you can always cut more if you need to!

TWICE’s Chaeyoung looks the epitome of cool with this textured bob, and the layers mean that it doesn’t have to be quite as precise as a blunt cut. As with any major chop, it’s always best to check in with a stylist first if you can. If you’re ready to take the plunge at home, cut in small increments and check regularly to ensure that the hair is an even length. (Leave more than you think you need, because you’ll be cutting in layers later.) Then, pin the top layers up and snip the ends, holding the scissors parallel to the hair to soften the style. Move to the next layer, gradually taking off more length as you go to achieve Chaeyoung’s choppy layers. If you’re unsure, be sure to consult a stylist or a video tutorial for more tips!

Okay, so technically this isn’t a hairstyle change – but it’s still a cool way to spice up your look! The eyebrow slit has been super on-trend for a little while now, and it doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon. The look is easy to achieve with an eyebrow razor, and it’s totally customizable because you can choose the placement to suit your face shape. Stray Kids’ leader Bang Chan gives a perfect example here, but there have been tons of other idols who’ve given the look a shot if you want more proof that the eyebrow slit is a total style game-changer.

Are you going to try any of these styles out for yourselves? Let us know in the comments below!These days, many of us have little choice but to stay home due to COVID-19. While avoiding going out is indeed one of the best preventative measures one can take and is absolutely necessary in some situations, it sure can get old quickly. Even for me, a self-proclaimed homebody, being stuck at home is a bit troubling, considering how much time I now devote to watching K-dramas (I highly recommend “The Cursed” and “Stove League“).

Recently, however, I realized that this might be an excellent time to learn a K-pop dance or two (or maybe 10). Not only will doing so give me another means of filling my free time, but it also might help me get my exercise schedule back on track. Of course, it’s also entirely possible I’ll wind up just watching dance practices for hours on end without actually trying them…

Anyway, whether you’re quickly turning into a full-fledged couch potato like me, trying to distract yourself from all the chaos, or just bored out of your mind while sitting at home, I hope these dances will add a little fun and joy to your day.

Boy is it tough to pick just one song by MONSTA X when pretty much all of their dances have iconic moments. I particularly like the dance for “Jealousy,” though, because of its use of relatively simple and often subtle movements that still manage to pack a real punch. Also, if you’re looking for a bit more detailed instruction on how to pull off some of these moves, then you’re in luck because the members themselves prepared a short tutorial!

This is by far one of my favorite song/dance combos from 2019. That said, while the song itself is addictive, what really drew me in was the choreo. Seriously, months later, I still can’t get over the move they do during the chorus that mimics the hands on a clock. Also, can you believe this is just a pre-debut single? I can only imagine what other dances these boys will come out with after they officially debut.

Although TWICE never fails to display their adorable charms while dancing, this is arguably one of their cutest choreos. And even if you have zero confidence in your dancing abilities, I’m certain anyone can at least follow along with some of TWICE’s knock-knocking, which is really the key element of the dance anyway. Please remember to minimize any real life door-knocking until after the coronavirus situation has calmed down though.

I’m pretty sure it’s impossible to not smile during this dance, regardless of whether you’re actively participating or simply watching. Then again, that might just be the HONEY10 in me talking. Nevertheless, this dance is a fun one that’s (almost) guaranteed to put you in good spirits with its high energy, youthful vibe.

If you’re looking to spice things up a little, then this one is for you. “Senorita” strikes a lovely balance between sexiness and classiness, incorporating lots of hand and arm movements that one can’t help but be drawn in by. Just be sure to exercise extra caution if you choose to sport your own pair of heels while practicing this dance.

In classic MOMOLAND fashion, the dance for “Thumbs Up” has lots of groovy hip swinging, particularly during the chorus. It’s also one of the easier ones to learn out of those listed here, making it a solid choice for beginners and anyone looking to just have a little casual fun. In fact, you really don’t even need to think about whether you should try this one or not — just put those thumbs up!

Does anything really need to be said to convince you that learning an ATEEZ dance is a must? Though, I must admit, these kings do set the bar pretty high given the intensity of both their movements and facial expressions. Even so, I encourage you to muster up all the confidence and ferocity you’ve got (summon your inner “Pirate King,” maybe?) and give this one a go.

In case one song called “Senorita” wasn’t enough for you, here’s another. There’s just something about Latin-style K-pop that makes you want to dance, no? It’s also nice to see that the choreography for this track incorporates some elements that were clearly inspired by Latin dance styles. By the way, if you want to see the key points from the chorus done a touch slower, give this mini dance class by VAV’s own BaRon a watch!

In terms of BTS’s discography, “Boy In Luv” may be a bit of an oldie at this point, but it’s still a goodie. This dance will definitely help you release any pent up energy you might be experiencing while stuck at home thanks its big, powerful moves. It might even help you cope with having to wait for their North American tour to be rescheduled, should you be impacted by the changes.

Looking to tone your arms this spring? While I can’t promise that this dance will give you your desired results, it’ll certainly have you making good use of all your arm muscles. Plus, the song itself is light and fun, making it hard to not want to groove along and “shake that boogie up.”

She also occasionally makes an appearance on Twitter (@_seheee).With the current COVID-19 pandemic that is rapidly taking over the world, most of us find ourselves in a state of mandatory confinement as a safety measure. While the first couple of weeks seemed more like a break from everyday life and obligations, people started to feel disheartened during quarantine, and that includes introverts who usually thrive in self-isolating as long as it’s voluntary. While this feels like being placed under house arrest, it can be an opportunity to appreciate having a home to safely shelter oneself from the risk of catching the coronavirus.

To chase the blues that have been accompanying this new and challenging situation, here is a selection of K-pop songs with various themes to highlight the fact that being home is not such a bad thing! (And yes, “Home” is the keyword in almost all of the titles.)

1. Epik High ft. Oh Hyuk – “Home is far away”

In this slow-paced song, according to Epik High and Oh Hyuk, home can be a place that allows you to put down the burdens that weigh your shoulders down and allow yourself to take a breather before you get back on your feet. Your fears and worries can chase you all they want, but you’ll always be able to silence them in the safe space that you call home.

The duo serenades us with this love story as they ask a past lover to come back home. The latter expression is both metaphorical and literal, since they consider their relationship a haven that brings them together and warms their hearts in the process.

Combining this emotional song with a dystopia-themed MV, 2NE1 shares the pain of constantly reminiscing about an ex-boyfriend and wondering whether there is still a chance to save the relationship. All of this is in the hope of reuniting once again to seek refuge in their binding love that used to fill their hearts.

SEVENTEEN sways us with a soothing rendition as they make a sweet love confession. Expressing their endless love and support, they reassure their love interest that they will always be on their side, thus bringing comfort and healing to their heart. They further address the many shared memories to emphasize their fruitful relationship before they ask their significant other to make themselves at “home.”

This energetic track doesn’t need an introduction nor a detailed description because the title says it all. When Mino and Bobby get together, you’re in for a wild ride. The lyrics are a vivid depiction of what could be the party of a lifetime, and this duo surely knows how to have fun! You can jam to this beat if you’re confined with other people: you might not have a full house, but it can still be a lit one!

Here is another invitation to a party, this time it’s from 2PM and the dress code is formal. As the sextet suggests in this vibrant and thrilling tune, you can meet interesting people amidst the crowd, maybe even your potential soulmate. However, going to someone’s house at the moment may not be advised. You can dance to this classic bop in the comfort of your own home for the time being!

Home can mean many things. To BTS, home is wherever their fans are. While they acknowledge the many achievements they made and the many dreams they saw come true so far, they admit that when they look back on their old days, they realize that their fandom ARMY has been there all along and that they eventually belong together.

The biggest boyband in the world, BTS, have conquered the K-Pop world and have now taken over the planet, but what does their name stand for, and what is the meaning behind it?

BTS have been around since 2013, but you very may well only be hearing about them in 2020, and that's ok, because they've officially taken over the world with their massive anthems, even bigger looks, and flawless dancing that's left everyone part of their ARMY.

What does BTS stand for?

The K-Pop supergroup, made up of 7 members, Jimin, RM, V, Suga, J-Hope, Jin and Jungkook, debuted with the name 'Bangtan Sonyeondan' in 2013, which translates into English as 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts' and gives them the catchy and accessible name 'BTS'.

They are most commonly called Bangtan Boys as an abbreviation for those who are fans, and BTS when travelling the globe for many different languages to understand.

They have rapped and sang referring to themselves as the bulletproof boy scouts on many occasions, with their song 'Attack on Bangtan' saying:

"Go forth like the Bulletproof Boy Scouts/Attack, aren’t we brave?/The brave Bulletproof Boy Scouts."

Their songs have also referenced ignoring and overcoming haters with their talents, which goes someway to explaining the 'bulletproof' title.

Why do they have multiple names?

Because why ever not?!

In 2017, BTS 'extended their identity' and announced through a dramatic YouTube video to reveal a new logo and the name 'Beyond the Scene', it was basically a full rebrand following touring in the US.

The band started as a much more hip hop based group in their rapping, styling and dancing but over time, have moved further towards pop with more light hearted, even artistic and modern style dancing.

Part of their vibe and style is to switch up their looks, musical styles and themes from album to album, so by 2017 it isn't surprising they wanted their group name to reflect these changes as they evolved as a band!

Photo: HandoutOur routines have definitely changed for the past month. We’re spending more time at home than ever before in order to contribute to our community’s safety. From what we eat, to how we connect with other people, and what we wear on the daily, things are a bit different now for all of us, but that doesn’t mean we can’t keep on experimenting! Staying in calls for comfy, useful, and multifaceted outfits you can wear all day long for all the activities you can get involved in while at home, from a morning video-call to a workout session or a virtual gathering with friends. In search of some inspo to come up with some fun-yet-comfy looks to stay at home in style? Take inspo from these idols and their cozy looks!

No matter if you choose a mix-and-match set or simply tops and bottoms that match colors, going for monochrome looks is always an easy yet stylish way to spark up your style while keeping it comfortable.

No matter if we’re talking about clothes inspired in pajama patterns, or simply pajamas, staying comfortable is goal number one, and there are ways to do it in style!

Moving around the house, we definitely want to be able to move around without feeling too tight. If you wanna add a touch of street to your at-home outfits but still stay comfy, try to wear oversized pieces together! Always stylish and ready to snug.

Simple, comfy, soft. Throwing on a hoodie is always a good idea and the answer to all of our staying-in dreams. From very long ones that resemble a dress, to short or cropped ones, it’s always nice to sink inside a soft piece of fleece.

Say hi to Caro on Instagram and Twitter!Is South Korea looking at another big coronavirus cluster?

Just yesterday (April 8), it was reported that Supernova's Jung Yoon-hak infected a female acquaintance A with Covid-19, who in turn infected her roommate, and potentially hundreds more.

As A works at an adult entertainment establishment in Gangnam (it is unclear what her job is exactly), many assumed that Yoon-hak visited the business, but his agency has rubbished those claims.

They said: "It's true that the adult entertainment establishment worker who has tested positive is an acquaintance of Yoon-hak's, however they just met at another location. Yoon-hak did not visit an adult entertainment establishment."

Still, many accusatory fingers are now pointing at the 35-year-old singer-actor for not self-quarantining himself after an overseas trip.

Yoon-hak was previously reported to have contracted Covid-19 after returning from Japan on March 24. He received a positive diagnosis on April 1, becoming the first South Korean celebrity to be infected with the coronavirus.

According to media reports, he met with A on March 26. The woman went to work as usual on March 27 and was there till the morning of March 28. It was reported that there were more than 100 staff as well as over 500 guests present at that time.

A developed symptoms on March 29 and was subsequently diagnosed with the coronavirus on April 2. She became Gangnam's 44th Covid-19 case.

Her roommate entered self-isolation after A was diagnosed, taking a test on April 2 which came back negative. However, she repeated the test again on April 5 and was diagnosed with Covid-19 the following day, becoming Gangnam's 51st case.

Officials have explained to Korean media that Case 44 contracted the disease from being in contact with Yoon-hak, while Case 51 contracted it from the former.

Yoon-hak has been receiving treatment for a week and while he initially had mild symptoms, he's now classified as a "critical patient" and is "focused on getting treated".

Officials are monitoring the staff and guests who were in the adult entertainment establishment during the time A was at work.

For the latest updates on the coronavirus, visit here.When Jihyo gets home after completing yet another grueling day of being Jihyo — international pop superstar and main vocalist of South Korea's best-selling girl group, TWICE — she changes into her coziest pajamas, ties her hair up, slips on her wire-frame, blue-light-protection glasses, and delves into the world of League of Legends. In the game, players join an ensemble of misfit “champions” who battle to dominate a map. But that's after this interview. Jihyo still has 45 minutes left today to be Jihyo, the leader of an ensemble of gorgeous idols singing and dancing in hopes of conquering the world. We're inside a windowless photo studio on a tranquil, residential hill in Seoul's fastest-paced neighborhood, Gangnam. Around us, the windows of plastic surgeons' offices and home-decor stores glitter into the evening. In the process of un-becoming Jihyo, the idol is peeling off her custom crystallized Unistella stick-on nails one by one and stacking them like tiny pancakes. Just 15 minutes ago, those nails coordinated with lilac, geode-like lids and a printed seafoam organza high-low blouse that Jihyo swirled in like she was filming the promo for flamenco night on a Korean version of Dancing With the Stars. The moment she entered the public eye, Jihyo became the internet's focal point, her life constantly being picked apart: her word choices, weight, facial expressions, relationships. She is probably aware I'm doing it to her right now. Soon she'll be in her happy place: at home with League of Legends. Online gaming lets the 23-year-old return to anonymity, even if it's only for a few moments a week. “I'm always tense and cautious about how people see me. But when I'm playing online games, I can feel the truest to myself,” she says through an interpreter, sinking back into her chair and clasping her hands. “Nobody can judge me through [the screen]. That's why I feel most comfortable.”

She hasn't been herself for years. TWICE debuted in October 2015, after an arduous five-month competition process brought together nine girls from South Korea, Japan, and Tainan for all to see on a reality show called Sixteen. Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu beat out seven other trainees to be in the group. All were from JYP Entertainment (JYP), one of Korea's most prominent entertainment companies, and took part in intense practice days for performances judged by the JYP of JYP, Park Jin Young, the company's founder (and an idol himself). Trainees, for those unfamiliar, are adolescents signed to a company in hopes of one day being picked for a K-pop group or solo debut. While they wait to be chosen, they sharpen their pop-star skills every day after school. Jihyo, of all the Sixteen contestants (and most other women in K-pop), had been in the trainee system the longest. TWICE's songs, which lease a spot in your brain as soon as you hear them, instantly started breaking global records not only in Korea but also on YouTube. Just after its first anniversary, TWICE racked up best new artist awards and South Korean President Moon Jae In used their song “Cheer Up” as his presidential campaign jingle. In 2018, TWICE won song of the year — for the third year in a row — at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. (The group that ended that streak: BTS, who, even if you've never heard of K-pop, you surely have heard of.) I’m always tense and cautious about how people see me. But when I’m playing online games, nobody can judge me through the screen.” It is not an overstatement to say that the girls are everywhere: onstage, on their new YouTube Originals series covering backstage, alongside tens of thousands of fan-made videos, and right there on the window of Lotte Duty Free, a major department store outside of my hotel in Seoul. The next day, I went to the Sephoraesque Chicor, and there were the girls again, soft-smiling back at me behind the display for an Estée Lauder cushion compact. (They're ambassadors for the brand in Korea.) This wasn't one of those situations when you finally meet someone you've lived down the street from for six years and suddenly start seeing them everywhere. I might have been attuned to TWICE, but the members' faces are unavoidable around South Korea's capital. No matter where you encounter them, Jihyo, as the leader, is always the nucleus of the group, with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Momo, Mina, Tzuyu, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung by her side.

Born Park Ji Soo in Guri, a city half an hour's drive from Seoul, Jihyo had never taken singing or dance lessons before she became a trainee at eight years old (she was scouted by JYP after placing in a child-actor competition). Instead, she spent her pre-fame years hiking up Achasan, a nearby mountain, with her fitness-focused parents. Approximately 99 percent of what Jihyo tells me is emphatically in Korean. The remaining 1 percent is a bashfully whispered "sorry" after revealing she was genetically blessed with clear, luminous skin and didn't experience breakouts grow- ing up. Maybe the purpling freckles under my foundation gave me away, but it's like Jihyo knew I had been given about 300 shallow injections of vitamins, Botox, and hyaluronic acid in my face by a dermatologist in Gangnam four days earlier — an attempt to achieve a porelessness I didn't inherit from my parents. "Because I started [performing] at a very young age, I felt like this is the only thing I could do," Jihyo says. This doesn't come out as existentially loaded as it may seem. If Jihyo is tired after a long day of shooting, I can't tell. Her voice is consistently lined with the same animated, melodic bubbliness of a TWICE song. She sounds just as bouncy when she nonchalantly discloses that she's been on a strict diet for most of her life: "I almost starved myself." Because I started so young, I felt like this was the only thing I could do.” Jihyo notices my eyes widen at least two centimeters and quickly clarifies: "I didn't really starve myself, [but] I had a hard time staying at a certain weight." On Sixteen, the show that chronicled TWICE's training process, Jihyo was repeatedly called out on her weight. These days, she doesn't feel compelled to fit an unrealistic body image. "I'm happy making money to buy delicious food and eat it with my friends," she says. "I don't think I have to look skinny." When Jihyo was named leader of TWICE after an anonymous vote by the other members — a position that comes with about as much responsibility as being the president of a small country — she took on new duties. Eight of them. In K-pop, holding such a position doesn't necessarily mean you're given the most lines or constantly put in the center of choreography. Instead, you act as the group's spokesperson and chief decision-maker. Jihyo conducts votes on what meals the girls will have, parts of their choreography, and living arrangements. (They've roomed together for years.) She gathers everyone's opinions and gives JYP staff the majority vote. "Since we've been together for five years, it takes less time to gather one opinion," Jihyo explains. Her charges include Mina, the Texas-born, Japan-raised group member. Her voice lilts like a Disney princess's, but she's far from timid with her words. There's Tzuyu, the youngest, who was added to the group by popular demand. There's Jeongyeon, who would go onstage bare-faced if you gave her the chance. (I can see my reflection on the apples of her cheeks.) But back to Jihyo: What's the best part of being the leader? She stares off at the eggshell wall behind me and raises her eyebrows, breaking into a laugh: "I think this is the kind of question you'd have to ask the other members." It occurs to me, that's exactly what an excellent leader would say. This cover story is a part of Allure’s “Beauty of K-Pop” project, where we explore how K-pop came to define more than just the global music scene.K-pop star Hong Jin-young has a new single out – but unlike poor Dua Lipa, isn’t having to promote it via lockdown.

The star has been celebrating new track Love Is Like a Petal in South Korea – one of a number of countries around the world to buck the full lockdown trend since coronavirus hit.

There was an early outbreak of cases in the country in late February and early March, but after extensive testing, the country has flattened the curve of new cases.

Hong, who was seen entering The KBS Broadcasting Station In Seoul to shoot a radio programme, is also known for songs like Love Tonight and Thumb Up.

The 34-year-old’s comeback track follows mass disruption to the global music industry.

For instance, Physical singer Dua has released her new album Love Nostalgia while stuck in a London Airbnb – it still charted amazingly. 



Lady Gaga, meanwhile, has pushed back the release of new album Chromatica until later in the year.

Other artists who have delayed albums include Alicia Keys, The 1975, Sam Smith, Alanis Morissette…

The list goes on.

However, some artists, like The Strokes and Charli XCX, are forging ahead by releasing new music – and now Hong, too.

Best of luck with the track, Hong, we love it.

MORE : K-pop star LE becomes last EXID member to leave their label Banana CultureIt was the century of blue jeans, Coca-Cola and Madonna. America was the barometer of cool. Where we sat in relation to its impulses, determined our proximity to modernity.

But it’s no longer the 20th century. The world has changed. American prestige has been replaced by Donald Trump. Africa is awash with zombie flicks from Nigeria or soapies from South Africa. The Asia Pacific region is seeing Indonesian cinema like never before.

In an increasingly multipolar world, with multiple actors pushing multiple agendas, the idea of American culture as the arbiter of our cultural universe is over. And in her new book, New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop, novelist and journalist Fatima Bhutto details the "new" cultural phenomena rising from the east, and sweeping the globe.

Hollywood may not yet be dead, but Turkish shows - popularly known as Dizi - Bollywood or Hindi popular cinema, and South Korean pop music, known affectionately as K-Pop, are at the forefront of challenging the mystique of American soft power, Bhutto writes in three essays that make up the book.

“To be American is no longer to belong to a vaunted, cultural elite,” she writes in her book, written as a light but thoughtful introduction to the new cultural motifs of our time.

Bhutto spends most of the book on India and Bollywood, including a profile on "the King of Bollywood", Shah Rukh Khan.

Bollywood has held a global audience for decades, starting with the former Soviet Union and North Africa as well as in the Middle East. In the 1950s, Bhutto notes, Lebanese businessmen living in Nigeria were importing Bollywood films into the country.

It is her second essay, on the global rise of Turkish television series, that is especially captivating and understated.

Those Turkish Dizi series have come a long way since the 1980s. Though they also adopt a slower form of storytelling, their emphasis on music, the visual and diverse modes of storytelling sets them apart from soaps and telenovelas. Each episode is also, in its own right (two hours long and with a vast production scale) an epic.

As the world’s second largest producer of television shows in the world, Dizi audiences span more than 100 countries, from South America, the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent, with translations available in Spanish, Farsi, Arabic and Italian. Not so much in the English-speaking world.

“Turkish television shows blazed through the subcontinent and far beyond because their heroes were modern, but not westernised [and] propelled purely by the righteous power of values,” Bhutto writes.

She says it is precisely Dizis’ ability to portray “modern life” without mimicking westernisation or American values that sets them apart. “They had achieved the perfect balance between secular modernity and middle-class conservatism,” she says.

The shows rarely depict women in the hijab, or the headscarf, which many women in Turkey wear, exemplifying the cultural tensions, even as they navigate age-old plots of love across class lines, estranged lovers and charismatic underdogs.

Moreover, the genre’s dexterity to be synonymous with human and societal issues in Turkey, sparking conversations about religion, nationalism, gender, violence and Ottoman history, has brought with it a universal appeal.

And there are reasons for that. Whereas American television can often revolve around individuals and offer a peek into loneliness, or obsessions with work, wealth and power as paragons of city life, Bhutto argues that Turkish Dizi “powered narratives that put values and principles in battle against the emotional and spiritual corruption of the modern world”.

“Turkish historical drama were not about wars in the Muslim lands like Homeland, or fiery sagas warning against unwashed villainous Muslim invaders: Here Muslims were kings,” Bhutto writes.

There is Fatmagul’un Sucu Ne? (What’s Fatmagul’s fault?), whose lead character bravely pursues justice after suffering gang rape at the hands of wealthy frat-boys. Magnificent Century told the story of a sultan’s love affair with a concubine, but was really about her “journey from slavery to becoming the queen of an empire”.

Likewise, where American television shows push the boundaries on questions of love or sexuality and take audiences to futuristic or dystopian neverlands, Turkish shows, Bhutto argues, are more relatable, or proffer a version of life audiences would love to lead.

She observes that audiences in Latin America have grown so tired of drug-related shows and highly charged sexual content from their North American neighbours, Dizis have become a staple of family viewing. Prior to Turkish shows running riot in the Middle East, including stealing attention away from the month of Ramadan (the fasting and religious obligations as well as the specially produced Arabic soap operas) or "causing" divorces, Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas were screened in places like Lebanon.

But more than television, they have also become immense and unnerving tools of Turkish soft power. And the scepticism of Turkish imperial ambitions is a recurring theme. One Lebanese voiceover artist tells Bhutto that the production values are so high, that Arabs, who might be ordinarily stiff to Ottoman history, allow themselves to be fooled into believing the stories and themes as their own.

The success of these shows in presenting an image of Turkey has also invited state scrutiny over subject matter and representations of the country. Every channel also carries a show venerating the state’s constant fight against enemies and traitors - inside and beyond.

Indeed, the Turkish state has made “direct and indirect impositions on the Turkish television industry from time to time due to concerns about the image of Turkey represented in these TV series,” Ece Algan, from the Institute for Media and Creative Industries at Loughborough University in London, wrote in the Heritage Turkey journal in 2018.

The Saudi blockade on Qatar (in which Turkey resolved to help Qatar) resulted in Dizi being taken off screens in parts of the Middle East. But this hasn’t stopped tourists from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from flocking to Istanbul.

Bhutto’s analysis of Dizi suffers a little for having been written mostly before the resounding success of Dirilis Ertugrul (Resurrection Ertugrul), the story of the son of Suleyman Shah and the father of Osman, the founder of the Ottoman Empire, that captured the imagination of many Muslims, and non-Muslims across the globe.

Ertugrul defies many of the conventions ascribed to the success of Dizi, with its tight adherence to and expression of Islamic values, including prayer, dress and philosophy, and for its willingness to depict war in shades of chivalry.

But the success of Ertugrul is indicative of Dizi being a “genre in progress”.

If Dizi firmly put Turkey on the modern cultural map, as a rearguard act to American soft power, Ertugrul ran riot among Muslims in the Middle East and in the English-speaking world as a symbol of justice and leadership. It also provided fodder for Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stir the neo-Ottoman imagination as a project of statecraft.

In her narration of a vast cultural movement sweeping through the globe, Bhutto’s keen eye for the odd and diffident makes her chapters on Dizi and Bollywood a treasure trove of secrets. She makes a series of important observations on the narrative junket proffered by Bollywood’s elite, led by arguably its biggest star, Shah Rukh Khan.

About his role in Bollywood’s expansion in the 1990s, she describes the films as a “strange marriage between the Indian neoliberal fantasy of money, power and [...] a distinctly cultural assertiveness”.

Bollywood is a shadow of its former self; intensely jingoistic, racy and pornographic in its depiction of wealth and excess. Though it remains popular as an alternative to American mainstream cinema, it has become increasingly indistinguishable from its American counterparts.

On K-Pop, Bhutto underlines the history of the pop music genre as an industry borne almost entirely out of an economic impulse to expand Korea’s exports. She describes K-Pop as “a perfect storm of colonial history, Americanised culture, and neoliberalism”.

In a theme that is repeated throughout the book, the new Kings of the World - as distinct as they might be - are also in many ways vaguely different versions of American culture; repurposed, repackaged, with a set of local values that are carefully manicured for the global market. Where Bollywood and K-Pop commodify good old Asian values into bubble gum limericks, Dizi is just enough of both worlds to make its mark.

Looks like we are having a problem on the server.K-pop stars often make the most of their fame by venturing into a diverse range of second careers, such as acting or business. In recent years, more and more K-pop stars’ names are appearing on the cast lists of major musical productions as idols establish themselves in the highly popular musical scene.

Initially, K-pop stars who landed major roles in musicals were met with hostility, as it was feared that musical actors - actors trained specifically in the genre - could lose out to big-name K-pop stars who enjoyed a huge following.

Indeed, some K-pop stars were awarded roles due to their popularity, not necessarily their talent. There were stars who could not adapt to the musical stage. Some were less than dedicated, skipping script readings and rehearsals, citing busy schedules.

Even stars like Ock Ju-hyun and Kim Jun-su had rough beginnings. But over the years they have become the best-known names in the musical scene and have proven their dedication.

Ock, a member of disbanded girl group Fin.K.L, turned to musicals in 2005, soon after the band broke up. After debuting in Aida, she went on to star in numerous musical productions, ranging from Chicago, Cats, Elisabeth, Monte Cristo” and Mata Hari to Marie Antoinette and Rebecca.

Kim Jun-su, formerly of boy band TVXQ, made his musical debut in 2010. Upon leaving TVXQ in 2009 following a legal dispute, he took the lead role in Mozart! and began a new chapter in his life - eventually starring in Elisabeth, Death Note, Dorian Gray, Xcalibur and more. Currently he stars in Dracula, which is set to resume its run on April 28 after a 20-day suspension as a precaution against Covid-19.

More K-pop singers have followed in the footsteps of Ock and Kim, taking on big and small roles in musical shows. Kyuhyun of Super Junior and Suho of Exo recently starred in The Man Who Laughs. Seohyun of Girls’ Generaton, Ken and Leo of Vixx, Lee Chang-sub of BtoB and Kei of Lovelyz are among the other K-pop stars who have ventured into the world of musicals.

“K-pop stars have a relatively short career lifespan - the maximum is usually eight years or so. After that, they have to find new careers, such as acting. Musicals, which involve singing and dancing, are certainly one of the choices for them,” said culture critic Jung Deok-hyeon.

“Of course, it’s not just about the guaranteed (pay cheque). There has to be a passion for musicals, ” he added. “But it is true that the musical genre is huge here.”

As Jung pointed out, musicals account for a large share of ticket sales in the performing arts scene here. According to the Korea Performing Arts Box Office Information System, musicals generated about 72.4% of ticket sales for performing arts productions in 2019, or US$136 mil (RM597mil).

Even during the COVID-19 crisis, which is pushing the performing arts scene to the brink, musicals accounted for up to 80% of total ticket sales, bringing in 8.08 billion won (RM28mil) in March.

Jung said the casting of K-pop stars could diversify musical audiences.

“Musical tickets are expensive, and middle-aged fans who play a central role in fan culture can afford them. They can spend the money to see their favourite stars perform onstage, ” Jung said. Musical tickets normally cost from 80,000 won (RM285) to 180,000 won (RM641).

By featuring K-pop stars, musicals are attracting younger patrons as well, who eventually become regular musicalgoers.

“It was Kim Jun-su who introduced me to musicals, ” said Kim Ju-hyun, an office worker in her early 30s. “I was a huge fan of TVXQ and especially Kim Jun-su in my teens. As he moved on to musicals, I started to attend musicals just because of him.”

Kim has since become an avowed musical enthusiast, attending even those not starring Kim Jun-su.

“Now I appreciate the genre itself. The art of singing and dancing onstage is magical, ” she said. “Without Kim Jun-su, I do not think I would have become interested in the genre.”

K-pop stars also bring international fans to South Korea and to the theatres.

At the theatres, foreign audience members anxiously awaiting shows can often be spotted.

“Some K-pop stars who are not that popular in Korea have enthusiastic fans overseas. For the international fans, to see their stars in musicals is a must-do when they visit Korea, ” an industry insider said.

Backed by K-pop star cast members, musical merchandise has taken off - with items featuring the celebrities including everything from posters to cups.

At the Korean premiere of Dracula in 2014, merchandise sales - mainly led by fans of Kim Jun-su - marked a total of 400 million won (RM1.4mil) in 50 days. In the second season, in 2016, purchasing limits were imposed because the demand was so strong. - The Korea Herald/Asia News NetworkThe Talko released a list of Top 10 K Pop Idols With The Best Fashion Sense and Taehyung was the only BTS member on the list.

There is no denying all the BTS members have a unique style statement. RM, Jin, Jimin, Suga, J-Hope, Jungkook and V have time and again giving us some fashion goals. But if you have been debating over who's the stylish BTS member, The Talko has tried to put the debate to rest with their new poll. The media platform which boasts of several million readers and over 7.88 million subscribers on YouTube, released their list of 10 K-Pop Idols With The Best Fashion Sense.

Surprisingly, their list featured only one BTS singer. Taehyung was the only Bangtan Boys member to feature on the list. The Sweet Night hitmaker found the fourth spot on the list. "(BTS) is great and each member of the group has their own super unique and cool sense of style, but when it comes to fashionable members of BTS, no one can beat V," the outlet wrote.

"V is constantly turning heads with his hair colors, but there's something else about his sense of style that fans have noticed: he loves Gucci. Even though most of us can't afford the same designer-filled wardrobe that K-Pop idols like V can, that doesn't mean that his head-to-toe Gucci outfits can't give us some style inspiration," the outlet added.

The singer was placed beneath Red Velvet’s Joy and Apink’s Son Na-Eun. SEVENTEEN’S The8 topped the list. The8 wasn't the only SEVENTEEN member on the list. SEVENTEEN's MinGyu grabbed the ninth spot on the list. Others on the list included BLACKPINK's Jennie and Big Bang's G-Dragon. Check out the complete list below:

Thanks to a new wave of innovative online performances in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and strict physical distancing measures, we’re about to find out.

With the performance market frozen due to the coronavirus pandemic, attempts by large K-pop agencies to come up with new online performance experiences are drawing attention.

Introduced last Sunday by SM Entertainment’s project group SuperM, “SuperM – Beyond the Future” made headlines in that it was the first “online” concert.

SuperM is the first installment in the “Beyond Live” performance series, in which SM produces content and Naver Co., South Korea’s top internet operator, provides the online platform.

Unlike live offline performances or online real-time performances in the past, the performance was planned in a new digital-oriented environment.

A tiger realized through augmented reality popped out of the screen, and real-time 3D graphics made it possible to see things only in online content through various technologies.

The good news is that unlike in-person concerts, there is no limit to accessibility and all spectators can enjoy performance details equally.

“I am satisfied that all the details that I could not fully incorporate in the on-site performance are being realized,” SuperM member Ten said at the concert.

SM also priced ‘tickets’ to the concert aggressively, at 33,000 won (US$26.92).

It is expected that 75,000 people watched the show simultaneously. Thus, it is estimated that SM generated more than 2.4 billion won in revenue from ticket sales alone.

Meanwhile, Big Hit Entertainment, K-pop boy band BTS’s management agency, has created emotional ties in a new way, bringing together fans scattered offline through platform technology.

On the April 18 and 19, Big Hit introduced “BTS Online Concert Weekend,” featuring eight BTS concerts and free fan meetings for 24 hours, with up to 2.24 million people watching.

In particular, what drew attention was the linking of “Army Bomb” light sticks to the video in real time through the band’s own fan community platform Weverse.

Confined to their homes, fans were unable to see the thousands of light sticks that dot the stands at a typical BTS show.

However, the color of the light sticks at each of the fans’ homes changed simultaneously to match the video, making fans feel connected to each other.

For two days, the number of “Army Bomb” light sticks connected reached about 500,000 in 162 regions around the world.

Fans shared their feelings of watching the performance together by sharing pictures of their cheering sticks and how they felt on social media.

In the meantime, Big Hit has focused its efforts on building its own platforms such as the global fan community Weverse and Fan Commerce Platform Weply.

It aims to combine BTS’ huge fandom with its own platform to create new fan experiences, communication and consumption methods. This attempt can also be interpreted in that context.

Attempts to perform online by two major agencies in a row are also expected to impact the local music industry, which is mulling a breakthrough in the wake of the “untact era.”

As the performance business, in which K-pop singers earn major sales, has been blocked by the spread of the coronavirus, the music industry is also turning online to diversify revenue streams.

However, concerns are also high because the online space has been geared more towards marketing efforts than a source of revenue.

“If YouTube has been used as a window for friendly content, all agencies will have the task of improving the quality of online content in general if they want customers to pay for it,” a K-pop industry official noted.

If online performances are established as a new model, attention is also being paid to how they will affect the landscape of the performance industry after the end of COVID-19.

Of course, many analyses have suggested that online performances have limitations in replacing the sense of unity and realism that only actual concert halls can offer.

“Online experiences that could not be attempted due to time or capital constraints will likely continue to be complementary to offline performances,” Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of liberal arts at George Mason University Korea predictedI Will Be Seriously Impressed If You Can Solve All These K-Pop Song Anagrams

This quiz is pretty hard! Or should I say... it's Pat Herd Try.New day, new K-pop drama alert! After a recent TikTok video went viral, people are speculating about CIX member Yoon Hyunsuk — namely, people are saying that the 18-year-old K-pop star is a single father of a young child. But wait! The rumors are not true! Here’s what we found out.

TikTok user @mari4president recently posted a video where she “revealed” that she had just discovered there’s a K-pop idol who is 18 and a single father. “His name is Hyunsuk and he’s a member of CIX,” she wrote. “And he’s cute and tall too.” OK, back up a second. There are some things that need some clarification here.

Yes, Hyunsuk is a member of . He was one of the South Korean band’s founding members (C9 Entertainment initially formed the group in 2019). And yes, Hyunsuk does appear to be quite tall. But the little kid in the photos @mari4president posted? Not his son!

That cute little boy is HyunYul, Hyunsuk’s little brother! Hyunsuk has three siblings and at 5 years old, HyunYul is the youngest of the family. CIX stans may remember HyunYul from his appearance in on CIX’s official YouTube channel from back in January. In the video, Hyunsuk shared footage of him and his family (including little HyunYul) going to an aquarium. HyunYul pretty much stole the show, and for good reason. Look at this adorable kid:

So cute, right? After visiting the aquarium, Hyunsuk and his siblings appear to visit a caricature artist as part of the vlog as well. Quite the eventful day, no? The comment section of the YouTube video is filled with people talking about how cute HyunYul is. And again, we totally get it.

If you didn’t happen to catch the vlog, you may have seen HyunYul in a selfie of Hyunsuk on the that was posted back in December of 2019. In the photo, Hyunsuk is posing with HyunYul sitting on his lap — and HyunYul is wearing the same adorable rabbit hoodie. Honestly, he should probably just wear that every day, right? It’s so stinking cute!

So, yeah, HyunYul — the adorable kid who appears in vlogs and photos with Hyunsuk — is not Hyunsuk’s son. Although he’s obviously a big part of Hyunsuk’s life! The comment section of @mari4president’s TikTok video seems to be pretty split between people being shocked at the news that 18-year-old Hyunsuk is a dad, and people clarifying that actually, he isn’t.

It’s not quite clear whether @mari4president actually thought Hyunsuk is a single dad, or if she was maybe just trying to make a funny video go viral. We’re guessing she definitely learned the truth after her video got popular, though! Either way, it doesn’t seem as though any harm has been done, and we can all rest assured that there aren’t any secret kids that the members of CIX have been hiding from all of us. Whew!South Korean singer IU suffered from an eating disorder called bulimia. Read on to what is bulimia and how you can fight the disease.

We often think that celebs are protected from the struggles that ‘common people’ experience, but that is not true. In fact, celebs are under more pressure to maintain their ‘star’ status in the public eye. They have pressure to maintain certain body standards which often leads to eating disorders and other mental health issues. Especially in the South Korean entertainment industry where being skinny is often associated with beauty.

Many stars successfully control their weight without causing any harm to their bodies, but there are some K-pop idols who developed serious eating disorders in the process. Lee Ji-eun, better known by her stage name IU, is another one of the South Korean celebs who suffered from bulimia. The singer-songwriter has been open about her struggle with bulimia for a long time. She revealed this information on Healing Camp in 2014 where she openly discussed the problem.

She talked about how she felt the pressure after her debut to become successful. She confessed, “I had bulimia… My weight decreased infinitely as I started to hate myself. I would be lethargic, and only eat and sleep.” She continued saying that she felt empty inside and would fill that void through food, that’s when the problem began. “Rather than feeling good, I always had the feeling of anxiety thinking there’s something lacking,” revealed IU.

“At that time, I ate until I threw up and I even sought treatment.” Despite the hardships, IU succeeded as an artist and today she is known as one of the top artists of the Korean industry.

If you’re someone suffering from bulimia nervosa or you know someone who is struggling with the eating disorder, here is what you need to know.

Bulimia nervosa is a serious eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating, followed by inappropriate methods and drastic methods to purge themselves, such as vomiting, fasting, compulsive exercising, etc. It involves a destructive cycle of binging and purging.

With a world dominated by physical appearance, this should not come as a shock that many people suffer from eating disorders. This is especially true for young adults and teenagers who feel the pressure to look attractive. A person suffering from this eating disorder needs physical as well as psychological support.

Here is what you can do if you or someone you know suffer from the condition:

1. Monitor what you’re eating to keep a check on your behavioural patterns. If you keep your food intake in check which in turn will help change the way you behave.

2. Make realistic meal plans that allow you to regulate your eating habits, prevent huger and alleviate binge eating. Make a proper plan on what, when and how to eat.

3. Notice what triggers the problems and try to prevent a binge-purge cycle. This habit can cause some serious physical and emotional damage.

4. Try to identify the underlying causes of the problem - is it work-related, family-related? Identifying the cause is important to address the problem.

5 Try to cope up with your feelings by talking to someone you trust. Being verbal about your thoughts might help you overcome the problem.

People with eating disorders don’t really speak up. So, if you notice someone around you who show signs of this eating disorder, it’s important to speak up. Don’t hesitate before asking someone – your hesitation might lead to drastic consequences for them.

Don’t ignore the signs and consult a professional doctor to help you overcome the health problem. Proper care, support and medication help you kick the problem to its curb. If left untreated, the condition will only get worse and the damage can be serious. While you can’t force somebody to seek treatment, but you can encourage them with your love and support.

Your comment has been submitted to the moderation queueOh My Girl are releasing new music later this month as a full group.

Member Jiho is returning from her hiatus to join Hyojung, Mimi, YooA, Seunghee, Arin and Binnie.

While details of their comeback are currently being kept under wrap, we do know to keep an eye out on 27 April for something new.

In a short and sweet statement to media, their agency WM Entertainment said: ‘Member Jiho’s condition has improved as she focused on recovery during her hiatus.

‘After continuous discussion with her, the final decision was made for her return.’

WM Entertainment revealed in January this year that Jiho will be taking a temporary break for health reasons, and had been receiving treatment in hospital since last year ‘due to frequent deterioration of her health and symptoms of anxiety.’

They added: ‘Recently, the symptoms of anxiety have worsened, and we decided that it would be difficult for her to carry out her activities as part of Oh My Girl as usual. To prioritise our artist’s health, we decided that she should take a temporary break.’

The comeback will be the group’s first in around eight months after the release of BUNGEE last August.

Oh My Girl also competed on the reality TV competition Queendom with the likes of MAMAMOO, AOA, Park Bom and (G)I-DLE.

Some of the best known hits include Liar Liar, Remember Me and Listen To My Word.

The group stands stock-still, heavy tension in their shoulders. The final count starts tallying numbers in various categories: digital sales, physical album sales, social media scores, online pre-voting, broadcast scores, and live votes, all metrics that aim to put a number on influence, on legacy. Lia, the group’s baby-faced 19-year old vocalist, takes a deep breath and grabs onto leader Yeji and the group’s rapper and dancer Ryujin.

Moments later — just nine days after debut — ITZY earned their first music show win for debut track “Dalla Dalla,” becoming the fastest girl-group in the industry history to do so. Audiences watched as the members, visibly flustered and teary-eyed, said the first of what would ultimately be many thank yous, after many wins.

Now, just over a year after their debut, ITZY has made being proud of who they are their ultimate ethos, with an enviable list of accomplishments to their name. Peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales Charts, “Dalla Dalla” registered 17.1 million "day-of" views on YouTube, breaking the record for the most viewed K-pop debut music video in history, according to Billboard. At the 2020 Korean Music Awards, ITZY earned two nominations — Best Pop Song and Rookie Of The Year — and the group was one of the few idol acts in the list, a feat they achieved by establishing themselves as a Gen Z K-pop group for whom self-expression and identity trump coming off as “likeable” or “soft-spoken,” as their fierce songs clarify.

And so they have the numbers, they have the wins. But part of ITZY’s magic is that as a concept, they can stand apart from those things. ITZY has ridden in on a platform of self-love, of not letting outside forces define you. No matter how much you stand out from the crowd, they say, it’s OK that “the kids and I are different,” as they sing on “Dalla Dalla.” The early music show victory reinforced to the industry that they’re a group to watch — but they’ve known that what they worked for and what they believed in mattered all along.Bright and irresistible, K-pop provides the beat to South Korea’s youth culture. But behind the perfect smiles and dance routines are tales of sexism and abuse

As students wait outside an exam room in Seoul’s affluent Gangnam district, the air is tense. A girl in a school uniform rocks a guitar back and forth in her hands next to a boy who stares nervously into his fringe. Another girl sitting on a nearby bench adjusts her crop top. But in a neighborhood filled with English and maths crammers, this is no normal exam room. Mudoctor Academy is a K-pop training school, where dozens of students between the ages of 12 and 26 line up for their chance to audition for a visiting entertainment scout.

Kevin Lee is among this group of hopefuls. At 19, he has already moonlighted as a backup dancer for the phenomenally successful K-pop group BTS. He estimates that he has attended more than 50 K-pop auditions over the past four years. But this hasn’t been enough.

Concerned about his age — most entertainment companies recruit school-aged trainees — Lee says he will give up on his dream if he isn’t accepted into a major entertainment company this year.

“It’s hard not to think about failure,” he says. “They say at 17 you have a 50 percent chance of becoming a trainee. I’m already 19 so my chances are slim.”

Lee is not alone — for many young Koreans K-pop is a desirable career choice and there are many academies like Mudoctor. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of this pop behemoth that has become South Korea’s best-known cultural export? It’s an industry worth US$5 billion; BTS alone sold more albums than Taylor Swift , Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande last year. But something is very wrong inside K-pop, and it points to a deeper malaise throughout South Korea.

There has been a spate of suicides and high-profile sex scandals involving K-pop stars in recent times. At the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music. Kim Jong-hyun , 27, a member of SHINee, took his own life in 2017 after speaking about the intense pressures brought on by success.

In March last year, several male K-pop stars, including Seungri, a member of boyband Big Bang, Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of FT Island, and singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young were implicated in a spycam sexual abuse scandal, after Jung shared videos of women in a group chat. The case resulted in five- and six-year prison sentences for them respectively for their roles in gang raping drunk, unconscious women.

Allegations also arose over Seungri’s ties to Burning Sun, a nightclub he founded where date-rape and sexual assault allegedly took place.

Then in October last year, Sulli , 25, a former member of the girl group f(x) killed herself. A month later, Goo Hara , 28, a former member of the group Kara and a close friend of Sulli, also took her own life.

It soon emerged that both women had been harassed online for months, if not years. Sulli had experienced sexist abuse and cyber-bullying from thousands of faceless male “anti-fans” (online haters) over her conduct and appearance. Goo had been hounded over a court case with an ex-boyfriend over a sex tape that had allegedly been filmed without her consent.

According to Mano Lee, a Seoul-based K-pop columnist, the sexism and misogyny that female stars face is a symptom of the way women are treated in wider society.

“A lot of Korean women can relate to the issues that female celebrities deal with. They have experienced it themselves. While many feel unsafe due to the pervasiveness of molka, gender-based violence and victim-shaming,” she says.

Molka — from mollae, Korean for secret, and ka for camera — means the illicit filming of women. There has been widespread outrage over the spycam epidemic. In 2018, almost 6,800 cases of hidden camera crimes were reported to the supreme prosecutors’ office. In some cases, cameras were hidden in women’s public toilets and motel rooms, others involved the filming and sharing of videos of women taken by partners and former partners.

The revelations of the Jung Joon-young spycam scandal provoked fury across the nation.

“K-pop tries to present a cleansed image of male stars as being kind, generous, that they are unlike patriarchal, sexist and unstylish Korean men,” says John Lie, a sociology professor at the

University of California, Berkeley. “The shock came because of the gulf between the illusion and the reality.”

Yet, though K-pop stars are expected to live up to all but impossible standards, many might say that the pressure to be perfect is also intense for ordinary Koreans — K-pop simply takes what’s there in wider society and intensifies it.

“In order to get ahead in Korea, you have to step on someone else,” says Justin Shin, a Seoul-based fashion photographer who works closely with K-pop idols. “It’s like this from kindergarten, you have to leap ahead of all the other kids. All their lives, Koreans are exposed to competition — constantly being tested, evaluated and scored over their actions and academic achievements. It’s super-competitive.”

For most South Koreans, success means having the right “specs” or specifications: everyone is judged in terms of their family background, level of education, job title, wealth and appearance. “If you went to a great school, or you have a nice body that you worked hard to cultivate, or if you have an expensive foreign car — these are all different forms of specs,” says Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul.

For women in particular, having the right specs means being attractive and excelling at homemaking. But, says Shin Gi-wook, professor of sociology at Stanford University, the natural consequences of such a highly competitive society are jealousy and bullying.

“Those who are more successful than others easily become the center of gossip and rumors,” he says. In Sulli and Goo’s cases, the public shaming they experienced can be seen as a more extreme example of the scrutiny and criticism all Korean women are subjected to.

Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was among the few K-pop stars who supported the nation’s feminist “no bra” movement, daring to challenge Korean society’s strict female dress codes. For this, as well as for her past relationship with Choiza, a fellow musician 14 years her senior, which began when she was 19, Sulli became the target of online abuse — K-pop stars are expected to stay single for years and not date during their teens.

Sulli tried to address her detractors by appearing on a TV talk show about the cyber-bullying that celebrities face, telling viewers, “My life is actually empty. I feel like I’m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.”

“So many celebrities have taken their lives because of this kind of criticism,” says one Korean jewellery designer who knew Sulli for many years and asked not to be named.

Lee explains that another K-pop star he works with once received a bloody dagger in the mail “with real blood” and that receiving angry threats and letters was normal for many K-pop idols.

Like Sulli, Goo had been the target of severe online bullying since late 2018, when she entered a court battle against Choi Jong-bum, an ex-boyfriend who she claimed had threatened to release a sex video allegedly filmed without her consent. Choi was later acquitted and although the video was never released, Goo suffered from the events and her all-important K-pop image was badly damaged.

“Korean celebrities who take their lives tend to be women, I don’t think that’s an accident,” says Hurt. “I think there’s a kind of precariousness that female stars have to live with that men don’t.”

It’s certainly true that male K-pop stars don’t have to worry about wearing the wrong suit, for instance, while, for female stars, the risks of deviating even slightly from strict expectations about appearance are dire.

“If you’re a woman your career can always end in an instant,” says Hurt. “You can be a top star but they’ll come after you with pitchforks. These women are stars, yet society is stacked against them. When police are coming at you, turning a victim into victimizer, it seems like a man can attack a female idol who has top lawyers and a big entertainment company behind her and still he has more protection.”

Back at Mudoctor Academy, Kim Tae-heon, 21, waits for his audition. Kim grew up in South Gyeongsang province in the rural southern region of the country. He moved to Seoul to attend the school two years ago and spends up to nine hours every day practising his singing, dancing and acting skills at the academy.

“Besides the obvious performance skills, you need a strong, stable mind to be able to do this,” he says. “I’ve seen people disappear along the way — at least six out of 10 will give up when they realize there are so many others who are better at this.”

For Kim, despite the intense competition, there is nothing else he could see himself doing. “Since I was young, I’ve always enjoyed being onstage. At school I would volunteer to sing or dance in front of others. It’s my joy in life.”

According to the academy’s founder Yoon Jin-hee, 386 former students — including Hye Bin from Momoland and Song Min-ho from Winner — have been recruited by major K-pop firms over the past five years. However, he admits the success rate is still very low. “Only 5-10 percent of our students make it past auditions,” he says. “I find the ones who are successful are the ones who practice all day. I see them at the academy all the time.”

Yoon says that around 40 percent of current students live outside Seoul. Many travel for hours every week by train or bus to get to and from the school, where they pay up to KRW600,000 (US$487) a month for the opportunity to become an idol. This work ethic is the backbone of K-pop according to Yoon.

“The reason K-pop became so successful was because of its intense training system? And if these companies want to continue innovating the industry, they need to upgrade the training system. These days, training is even longer and harder. But most of the better entertainment companies try to make this process as enjoyable as they can for trainees.”

Even for those who graduate to stardom, the hard work doesn’t end.

Kevin Lee realized this while working behind the scenes with BTS.

“When we went to dance practice for their shows, they’d always be arriving straight from their tours in other countries,” he says. “As soon as they get back they would go to practice for seven hours a day.

While some criticism regarding K-pop’s grueling training process is valid, Yoon says South Koreans study just as much to pass suneung, the country’s national university entrance exam, and work as hard at entering other careers, such as the civil service and legal professions.

“K-pop is portrayed as this factory-like industry, but I question this view, because everyone in Korea is forced to study for years. If anything, people who are training to become idols are training for something they actually want to become,” he says. “They are living every day with a purpose and with a dream. And there’s freedom in that.”

Many, however, see things differently. The demanding nature of the industry can mean signing contracts that can leave stars feeling trapped. According to K-pop star Prince Mak, contracts can lock you in for up to 15 years, and the term doesn’t begin to count down until you are deemed a success, which can lock you in for years beyond the top line, while you are trained.

In the wake of their the deaths of Sulli and Goo, the South Korean government discussed passing a new bill that would introduce cyber-bullying education at schools and workplaces. However, many believe policy alone is no solution, and the cause goes straight to the heart of societal expectations.

“K-pop has gone international and it brings pride to the country, but there’s this cultural program of gender and social norms that’s impossible to win,” says Hurt. “You’d have to really thread a needle in a particular and perfect way, and I think that’s the thing about these K-pop stars going out into the spotlight? They can’t really win.”2021 torrents site means one thing is sure you are searching for the most reliable and more authentic place to download movies and games....Ye-eun, a former member of K-pop girl band Wonder Girls, is not a stranger to fame: her group won countless awards and gained popularity across generations of fans. Thanks to its addictive megahit songs like "Tell Me" and "Nobody," Wonder Girls were undeniably the top female K-pop group of their times in Korea, starting in 2007, which helped them make their U.S. debut and sustain a performance schedule there for years as well. 

 Even though the group disbanded after a decade of activity in 2017, which included several years of intermittent hiatus, they are remembered as a girl group that made history on the K-pop scene.

 Ye-eun was the only member who stayed in Wonder Girls from the beginning to the end, which could be interpreted as her faithfully carrying out her role as a somewhat standardized K-pop female singer. Because girl groups at that time normally sang songs about girls' broken hearts after breakups with their boyfriends, many were surprised when she came back to the stage in 2014 as a soloist with a new stage name "Ha:tfelt" and sang songs with lyrics which were her personal story.

 Since her debut as a solo artist and an all-round performer, from composer to singer, Ha:tfelt has released numerous songs which contain various influences as well as esoteric lyrics, new for audiences who are still familiar with her style as Ye-eun from Wonder Girls. Some found it difficult to match her new songs with her image, but she gradually gained popularity among critics, which helped her to a best pop song nomination in the 2015 Korean Musical Awards (KMA), and win the Netizen's Choice award there.

 When she parted ways with her agency JYP Entertainment and signed a contract with Amoeba Culture in 2017, it appeared that she would continue to build a steady career as a solo artist. But she faced personal struggles from 2017, including alleged involvement in her father's fraud cases and his sexual abuse of minors. She was cleared of any involvement in his fraudulent activities, but her relationship with her father made her suffer. In those times, she struggled and was suffering from depression, even thinking about taking her life, she recalled. She was broken but did not crumble. Instead, she confronted harsh reality. She expressed her sufferings through her art and healed herself, and the songs that came out have resonated with others as well.



"1719," her recent full-length studio album, was released Thursday and her book related to the album, were made during the darkest times. The title has three meanings; one is the age between 17 and 19, one is the time between 17:00 and 19:00 and one is the year between 2017 and 2019.

 She said her album is about the process of recovery from darkness to the light in her life; and from the suicidal thoughts between 2017 and 2019 in particular.

 "To be honest, I thought about killing myself a lot in the last three years. I wanted to do something with the thought and talk about my experiences through this album in order not to die. I couldn't figure out how I am still alive and I thought I was alone many times. But at some point I realized that I was not alone and surrounded by my people who will catch me when I fall. The album is talking about the process," Ha:tfelt said during a roundtable interview with reporters April 16 held to promote the new album. She also shared her thoughts in a written interview with The Korea Times.

 During the interview, she declined to share in great detail about what exactly happened to her and why she suffered so much. But she implied that in a book (of essays and poems) she wrote in which she mentions her relationship with her father and how his poor behavior angered her, and how her being implicated in his misdeeds made things very difficult for her. She wasn't able to write songs for about a year while feeling depressed. She even wasn't able to move from her couch at times and found out she had a hoarding disorder. Ha:tfelt started to see a counselor.

 "As I wrote in the book, I felt like I was drowning, feeling trapped and hard to breath, which is the reason for the subtitle, 'About the times when I was stuck.' I received counseling for about one year and my counselor recommended I write stories about myself."

 "At that time, I also became skeptical about success and started to think about the reason I was alive… I tried to overcome, let go or fight against the negative thoughts, but ended up going with the flow as time goes. After three years, I was able to take control of my life."

 It was music that helped her back to a normal life.

 "I thought of giving up my career…. But I remembered in the most difficult times, music protected me." She wrote that when she thought she would have only three years left to make music, she felt a pain in her heart. "I realized that I am still in love with music." She added that her childhood memories of wanting to become a singer also helped her not give up her musical career.

 After realizing her deep love of music, she was able to solely focus on making the album over the last five month. "I stopped drinking, canceled every appointment and spent about five months for the album."

 When asked about the reason why she created the album and wrote the book about her personal life, she said "Thinking about something in your mind and writing it are totally different. When I express myself in written language, I experienced that my tangled thoughts became unraveled in a therapeutic way. And I found out that sharing the experiences helped me heal together with many people who had similar experiences to me."

 That's another reason she chose "Satellite" as her lead off song, because it is bright and talks about real-life experiences that she can share with many people.

 She added that her album could give people warmth in their lives too; as it has done for her.

 "I put everything into this album… The process of making the album was chaotic but I feel thankful that I realized that I love music and could make it again. When I look back in the future, I will feel warmth from these days… I will remember the days for a long time. It will be great if other people have similar feelings about my album."

 She also hoped that people who are in their darkest times of life will not give up.

 "I ask them to hang in there. The end of the darkness will definitely come, even though it feels like it is coming slowly."Winnie Zhong Feifei is one of 101 female trainees taking part in singing competition show Produce Camp 2020, a spin-off of the famed South Korean K-pop reality show Produce 101.Admit it: It's easy to get so lost watching TikTok videos that you spend hours endlessly scrolling without even realizing it.

All those who had been disappointed following the cancellation of BTS concerts across countries can now heave a sigh of relief for the popular Korean pop band BTS has decided upon online concert series to appease the fans.

The band said that a new online concert series, titled "Bang Bang Con", which will offer fans a chance to watch the band's previous concerts and also fan meets that happened earlier.

The online concert series will be divided into eight parts and will stream online in the weekend (April 18-19). The BTS online concert series Bang Bang Con will stream online on BTS' official YouTube channel, BANGTANTV.

Wait, that is not all. Fans don't have to shell out a penny to watch these. As per Billboard, the BTS online concert series will be available to stream for free.

It may be recalled that like every other English band, the famous K pop band, BTS too, put off their worldwide Map of the Soul tour owing to the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus that has crippled normal life across the globe.

At least, with this announcement, BTS fans can be happy that there is something to look forward to. So, what are you waiting for? get ready to groove to the beats of BTS!South Korea's K-pop boyband BTS will suspend their world tour over worries about the spread of the novel coronavirus and restrictions aimed at stopping it, their management said on Tuesday.

The seven-member band had already postponed the North American leg of the tour, that was scheduled to start on April 25, and cancelled a Seoul concert because of the coronavirus outbreak.

"Due to the nature of BTS concerts involving travel by thousands of international fans no matter where the performances are held, it is also difficult to resume the tour with the current strict restrictions on cross-border movement still in place," Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement.

"Therefore, we have made the difficult decision to suspend the previously announced tour schedule and develop a new schedule," the statement said.

The suspension of the tour, which was due to include concerts in Europe and Japan, comes as the coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 3 million people globally, with countries imposing travel restriction and lockdowns.

Big Hit Entertainment said it would give details of a new tour schedule as soon as they were clear.MBTI, short for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is a personality test that has rapidly been gaining popularity among both K-pop idols and fans alike. In the test, you are assigned a personality type made up of four different letters that correspond to the following traits: Introverted (I) vs. Extraverted (E), Observant (S) vs. Intuitive (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Prospecting (P).

Now that many idols have revealed their own MBTI types, fans have taken the trend one step further by creating their own unique MBTI tests for idols such as BTS’s Jin, NU’EST’s Minhyun, Red Velvet’s Wendy, TWICE’s Jihyo, Stray Kids’ Felix, TXT’s Soobin, and many more!

These fan-made tests typically consist of eight or more pictures of the same idol, along with a word to describe the main attribute in each picture. The attributes could be anything from the idol’s outfits and hairstyles to their habits or the animals they resemble. Each of these attributes is assigned a different letter, much like the personality traits in the original MBTI test. However, since these aren’t real MBTI tests, the letters that you are assigned reflect what you like about the idol rather than reflecting aspects of your own personality.

The best part about these clever fan-made tests is that they only take a few seconds to complete! All you have to do is choose the picture or trait you like more from each category. Then put all the letters together, and you have your very own fan MBTI type.

Let’s take a look at an example. The MBTI test for BTS’s Jin below asks you to choose between the following options: Cute (C) vs. Sexy (S), Black hair (B) vs. Bleached hair (D), Awake (A) vs. Epiphany (E), and Wolf (W) vs. Hamster (H).

So, if you like Jin’s cute side, his black hair, his solo track “Epiphany,” and you think he resembles a hamster, your fan MBTI would be CBEH.

Try a few more of the tests below! Make sure to click on each tweet to see the full image. Maybe you’ll even find some inspiration to make an MBTI test for your own favorite idol!

What are your results? Let us know in the comments!A new series of K-pop concerts is coming to the closest screen near you.

SM Entertainment boy bands SuperM, WayV, NCT Dream, and NCT 127 will be featured as the first artists appearing on the Beyond Live streaming concert service created in collaboration between SM and Korean tech giant Naver. Facilitated by Naver’s V Live streaming app, the lineup was announced on Tuesday (April 21) heralding, "A new era of live concert begins."

The Beyond Live concert streaming service will kick off on Sunday (April 26) with SuperM's show and then feature following events on each consecutive Sundays throughout May 17; each show will begin at 3pm in South Korea, which is at 2AM in the U.S.'s east coast and 11pm in the U.S.'s west coast the day prior.

The concert series comes amid the global COVID-19 coronavirus-caused pandemic, which has led to a near-complete halt to live music events. Live streaming events have become popular as an alternative, but the Beyond Series is also a way to bring K-pop live concerts to fans across the globe even beyond these extenuating circumstances, and will apparently tie into upcoming already-announced releases from both NCT Dream and NCT 127.

Though K-pop concerts have been streamed live in the past before, including other SM Entertainment events, the Beyond Live series systematically offers up a monetized alternative to live concert experiences, including the ticketing: the first Beyond Live concert featuring SuperM is currently priced at around $30 to access on two devices via Naver’s V App, making the K-pop concert quartet cost a total of $120 for anyone who wants to tune in to the whole bunch. Fans who opt to spend more are able to also purchase merchandise.

The Beyond Live series is the first wide-scale K-pop concert series to go wholly online during the coronavirus pandemic, and follows last week’s BTS Bang Bang Con event, which raked in over 50.5 million views as that band’s fandom, ARMY, tuned in to walk down memory lane and watch nearly 24-hours-worth of past concert content.

The global shift to social distancing in the face of the spread of COVID-19 has provided an opportunity for many K-pop acts to innovate ways in order to engage with their digital-savvy audience, and introduce new products that will likely become a mainstay of their business structure following the period.

The Beyond Live concert streaming service is able to solve a major concern for many K-pop fans around the globe who, coronavirus isolation aside, are unable to see concerts in-person when few K-pop acts travel beyond Asia for concert tours. Recent years have seen many broaden their reach, hitting up cities throughout North and South Americas, Europe, and Australia, but with a far-reaching audience that spans the expanse of the Earth, live-streaming concerts is an obvious answer to bringing live events to fans in different locales. Though some fans are able to travel for concerts beyond the confines of their hometown, K-pop’s a digitally-grown medium and trying to institute a long term alternative to in-person events is likely to be lucrative.

Only time, and metrics, will tell how well the Beyond Live concert series pays off regarding both profit and fan engagement, but as the foreseeable future sees a halt to the global concert industry, it’s as good as time as ever to try something new.The Korean Business Research Institute has revealed the brand reputation rankings among male idol groups for April!

This April, well-loved K-Pop boy groups BTS, SEVENTEEN, and EXO have reigned as the leading stars of brand rankings!

The rankings are grounded on various factors including consumer media, communication, and community indices. Particularly, the institute has extracted a huge amount of data from March 9 to April 10.

Maintaining the glorious number one spot is none other than the worldwide K-Pop boy group BTS. Notably, the septet has been leading the brand rankings for 23rd straight months now. The boys were able to hold on to their rank through their impressive brand reputation index of 11,744,497.

Some of the high-ranking phrases from the group’s keyword analysis included “album”, “Billboard”, and “YouTube.” The positive words such as “cheer on”, “enjoy”, and “like” are also present as their highest-ranking related terms.

Rising up on the brand rankings is the multi-talented idol group SEVENTEEN. Previously at the fifth spot, the shining K-pop act was able to obtain the second place this April after scoring a brand reputation index of 3,908,014.

Placing fourth and fifth in the rankings are NCT and WINNER. Super Junior obtained the sixth spot while rising boy group ONEUS rose to seventh rank. Completing this month’s top ten are SHINee, INFINITE, and VICTON who grabbed the eighth to tenth places, respectively.

Check out the other K-Pop boy groups who entered the Top 30 in April 2020 below:Did someone say “K-pop and classical music crossover”? It sounds interesting to put these two genres together, but this combination is definitely not unheard of! In fact, you might not have known that some of your favorite K-pop songs—both old and new—have taken inspiration from even older pieces of music.

Here are 10 examples of K-pop songs that borrow from classical music of the 17th to 19th centuries!

One K-pop-classical-crossover song that comes to mind is “TOPDOG” by ToppDogg (now known as XENO-T). Released in 2014, the music video and song are heavily based on classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s musical works as well as his infamous rivalry against fellow composer Antonio Salieri. You can see the modern interpretation of this artistic tension in the CGI-filled music video and hear references to Mozart’s famous “Rondo Alla Turca” as well as the first and fourth movements of his Symphony No. 25 in G minor in ToppDogg’s song.

Does the Hello Venus’s 2013 song “Would You Stay for Tea?” sound familiar? It’s because the song uses melodies and chord progressions from Johann Pachelbel’s “Canon in D”! Although Pachelbel is the oldest composer on the list, his famous tune from “Canon in D” certainly does not sound dated in Hello Venus’s sparkly reimagining of this popular composition.

Ludwig van Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata” sets a perfectly moody atmosphere for VIXX’s “Fantasy.” This successful pairing of music from 1801 and 2016 only goes to show how beautiful melodies and emotions withstand the test of time. I’d consider this a job well done by all composers!

FTISLAND released their emotionally charged “Missing You” in 2009. Once engrossed in the dramatic music video, it can be easy to miss that this song actually borrows from the first movement of Antonio Vivaldi’s “Winter,” the last concerto of his famous The Four Seasons. The high-energy violins and charming harpsichord add the final touch to one of FTISLAND’s earlier tracks.

Speaking of Vivaldi, “The Day After You Left” is an old-but-gold song from 1997 by singer-turned-actor Lee Hyun Woo. Like FTISLAND’s “Missing You,” “The Day After You Left” also features violin melodies from Vivaldi’s “Winter,” but this time, they originate from the second movement. You can hear how Lee Hyun Woo’s song captures more of Vivaldi’s gentle and sweet sounds.

Another classic oldie—Park Ji Yoon of the widely covered “Coming of Age Ceremony” has a song inspired by Georges Bizet’s opera “Carmen.” “Song of the Moonlight” integrates the rhythmical writing from one of the opera’s more recognizable arias, “Habanera,” into a danceable, flamenco-inspired track.

The fast and catchy riffs from DreamCatcher’s “Good Night” actually had their roots in a much older piece of music. Baroque composer George Frideric Handel had created a smart chord progression in his Suite No. 7 in G minor that DreamCatcher then incorporated into their signature rock sound—and it worked!

The piano in GFRIEND’s “Summer Rain” imitates the melodies of German composer Robert Schumann’s “Dichterliebe” or “A Poet’s Love” in the girl group’s snappier, modern take of this 1800s composition. You can still sense the feelings of longing and melancholy in both pieces, as nothing is lost in translation.

Oh My Girl’s performance of “Love Song” on “Sugar Man 2” pays tribute to the disbanded girl group 7Princess’s nationwide hit. The popular tune in the chorus is actually composer Edward Elgar’s heartfelt melody from his violin piece “Salut d’Amour” or “Love’s Greeting” turned into a cute and catchy pop song!

Of course we didn’t forget Cherry Bullet’s “Hands Up,” and we sure couldn’t forget this addictive tune after hearing it for the first time, Cherry Bullet style! As many listeners have noticed, “Hands Up” takes great inspiration from Beethoven’s “Fur Elise,” turning that stormy piano piece into a trendy hip hop track that stays in our heads for days.

Mnet’s new show Road To Kingdom is all set to premiere on April 30, 2020. It will witness seven talented K-pop acts vying to best each other.
• Broadcast Date Of Mnet’s “Road To Kingdom” Confirmed + Sneak Peek Of The Performances

Road to Kingdom is a spinoff of Queendom, an entertainment show that aired last year. Six popular girl groups performed their songs and covered others to determine “the real number one”, with MAMAMOO going on to win the competition.

Through Road to Kingdom, the boy groups will showcase their musical prowess through various performances post which the viewers will decide and take vote on their favorite team and stages. The winner will then go on to join the subsequent show Kingdom.

Teaser clips of the competitors’ first performances were released online along with a preshow preference poll that will be open until April 5 for fans to show support. The results will be aired during the show. However, it won’t be reflected as extra points in the actual competition.

Get to know the 7 boy bands who are gearing to charm you all as they put on a spectacular show on “Road To Kingdom.” They are:

Pentagon is the oldest band on the show with respect to their debut date as compared to the other groups. The group debuted under CUBE Entertainment on October 10, 2016. Initially starting out with 10 members, it was praised for its diversity within the group with Hui (leader), Jinho, Hongseok, Shinwon, Yeo One, Kino, Wooseo being Korean. Meanwhile, Yan An is Chinese and Yuto is Japanese.

Pentagon has been deemed as somewhat of a total package with the members’ impressive vocals and dances while being also adept at acting and foreign languages. The group also recently made a superb comeback with their first full-length album titled, Universe: The Black Hall, featuring 11 tracks of which the members wrote the lyrics.

It is most likely that the group will participate as an 8-piece group on the show since Yan An who has been on a hiatus since his injury in 2017 did not appear on the teaser of the show. Former member E’Dawn left the group in 2018 after his relationship with HyunA went public.

Originally debuted on August 2, 2017 under WM Entertainment with their first mini album On/Off, ONF is now a 6-member group after member Laun left the group and terminated his contract with WM due to personal reasons.

The group boasts of a unique setup with two subunits each having its own leader: “ON” team with Hyojin (leader), E-Tion and MK and “OFF” team with J-US (leader), Wyatt and U.

“ON” consists of the team’s vocalists and delves into a more sentimental approach with upbeat tracks, while “OFF” features the rap line with powerful, dance-oriented performances.

Since the release of their debut album, the members had also participated in a survival audition program, Mix Nine, where member Hyojin ultimately ranked second.

ONF will probably stay true to their dual concepts for Road To Kingdom as they appear to give two contrasting performances in the released teaser.

Golden Child is a 10-member group under Woollim Entertainment consisting of members Daeyeol (leader), Y, Jangjun, TAG, Seungmin, Jaehyun, Jibeom, Donghyun, Joochan and Bomin. They debuted around the same time as ONF on August 28, 2017 with their first mini album Gol-Cha!.

The group is the label’s first boy group in seven years after Infinite; and coincidentally, Daeyeol is Infinite member Sungyeol’s brother.

Golden Child made their way into Billboard’s “10 Best New K-Pop Acts in 2017” after they made an impressive debut with the title track “DamDaDi”.

However, they went on a year-long hiatus during which it was announced that Jaeseok would be leaving the group due to health reasons. Golden Child made a very strong comeback in November 2019, with their first full-length album Re:BOOT. They dazzled with their more edgy and mature concept post which they also held their first solo concert as well.

Housed by Cre.Ker Entertainment, The Boyz is an 11-member group that debuted on December 6, 2017. The group consists of Sangyeon, Jacob, Younghoon, Hyunjae, Juyeon, Kevin, New, Q, Juhaknyeon, Sunwoo, and Eric. Former member Hwall left the group on October 22, 2019 due to health concerns.

The Boyz have gone on to accomplish a lot since their debut in 2017. The group recently released their first full-length album Reveal that according to leader Sangyeon was an insight on the biggest transformation that the group underwent since debut, and that they hope to show their growth continuously onstage. They even went onto hold concerts in 12 cities across Asia and Europe.

While The Boyz were all set to have their first solo concert in Korea in March, it was later was canceled due to COVID-19.

The teaser released for the band promises very intriguing performances by them especially with the snippet of their choreographed sword dance.

Made up of 7 members, namely, Dongheon, Hoyoung, Minchan, Gyehyeon, Yeonho, Yongseung and Kangmin, VERIVERY debuted under Jellyfish Entertainment on January 9, 2019.

VERIVERY earned the nickname “creative-dol,” for their wide array of talents such as shooting their own concept photos as well as designing the cover art for their latest mini-album Face Me. They have also taken part in the creative process of their music videos and have even directed them as “DIY music videos” whilst also writing and composing their songs, choreographing and filming videos for their social media as well.

VERIVERY plans on releasing two other albums after Face Me as a part of the Face It series that will be a portrayal of them of overcome their limits after failures, heartbreaks and downfalls and success.

ONEUS debuted on the same day as VERIVERY under RBW Entertainment. The group consists of 6 members: Ravn, Seoho, Leedo, Keonhee, Hwanwoong, and Xion. Unlike other idol groups, the group does not have a leader because they believe each member is an expert in their field. Hence, they can lead each other.

The act is also known to write and compose their own music. They have strong sense of teamwork as reflected in the band’s name as well as their albums’ titles such as Light Us, Raise Us and Fly With Us.

TOO, also known as Ten Oriented Orchestra, is a boy group under N.CH Entertainment formed through the survival show World Klass. They debuted on April 1, 2020 with the 1st mini album REASON FOR BEING: 仁 (Rememberance)

Each member in the band represents one of the ten fundamental values from ancient Eastern philosophy. While there has been quite a lot of skepticism on whether the group will be able to compete with veteran groups like Pentagon, it will be exciting to see how they stand up against them as a rookie group.In our previous post, we’ve revealed some of your favourite Hallyu actor’s photos during their younger days – and we can say that the results were well…quite shocking for some.

It's not as easy as you think...SEOUL: Popular K-Pop band BLACKPINK member Lisa has been accused of plagiarising choreography of a black choreographer named Cierra Nichols.

Lisa posted a video of her performing a dance style to the number "Mushroom Chocolate" before Nichols accused her of stealing her choreography, reports aceshowbiz.com.

In the K-pop star's video, Lisa could be seen performing while lying on the floor, she later got back up and continued her routine, reports aceshowbiz.com.

In Cierra's video, which was uploaded a month before Lisa's, she mostly danced laying on the floor.

When Cierra got to know about Lisa's choreography, she took to Instagram to call her out saying: "In today's episode of 'Let's Steal from Black People' a Korean singer gets 7.8 million views in a day using most of your choreography. Love that for us."

Cierra then took to Twitter and wrote: "Convinced people can't read. I know to credit someone if I clearly pulled from it. I seen the inspiration the girl looks great."

"It's okay, though doesn't look s**t like when I did it anyway."

Cierra even responded to a social media user who watched her video after looking at Lisa's: "Because of Lisa and her choreographer using my moves."

In another post, she insisted: "It's not about the drama girl I could care less but it's clear where the beginning got its inspiration. It's clear there not doing anything like mine. That's why I'm fine."

Lisa has not replied to the accusations yet.The lead singer celebrates his birthday this weekend and is loved by fans in Korea and Japan for his goofy antics and sexy charmsJakarta, Insertlive - Rapper dalam Kpop menjadi elemen penting dalam satu kelompok musik di industri hiburan.

Lee Han-gyul and Nam Do-hyon have united to bless us all with H&D, making their official debut on 21 April.

The duo – who are signed up with PocketDol Studio – have also released mini album Soulmate, as well as singles Soul and Good Night.

Moments after their debut, they began trending worldwide on Twitter, as impressed followers rushed to praise them.

‘Hangyul and Dohyon, you’ve worked hard best boys. you deserve nothing but all the best things in the world & let’s walk only on flowery path,’ a fan posted.

‘We will always be on your side just like how you are always on our side, I am so proud of you! congratulations on your debut as “H&D,”’ one said.

While a Twitter user said: ‘Congrats and goodluck for the album. I wish H&D success and lets walk in flowers with your fans. So H&D deserves to be happy and amazing (sic).’

While it might have its critics, it can't be denied that Korean pop music (or K-Pop) has not only made an impression on audiences in the U.S., but is stateside for the long-haul. Need proof? Look no further than the popularity of Korean boyband BTS.

The seven-person group (comprised of members V, J-Hope, Jimin, RM, Suga, Jungkook, and Jin) has taken America by storm ever since they became "only the third group in 50 years to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200 charts in less than 12 months," per CNN. The two other groups? The Beatles and The Monkees. Fittingly, CNN even compared BTS' American debut to Beatlemania.

That being said, BTS is far from the only K-Pop mega-group to have made its mark in the hearts (and ears) of American music-lovers. Blackpink, a four-part all-female K-Pop group (made up of members Jisoo, Lisa, Rosé, and Jennie), have been long-standing darlings of the South Korean pop scene since 2016. The group managed to make its debut on the Billboard 200 in 2019 with the EP "Kill This Love" and a single of the same name, complete with an American tour and a history-making performance at one of the United States' biggest music festivals.

Even though BTS was previously on hiatus and Blackpink took a break as well, it's beginning to look like we have a battle of the (K-Pop) bands on our hands. If that's the case, does this mean Blackpink will be a threat to BTS in 2020?Jackson Wang's story feels ripe for a Hollywood biopic. In fact, if the 26-year-old singer/rapper/K-pop idol/entrepreneur and Fendi fashion muse continues on his current trajectory, that sort of pipe dream might just become a reality.

Wang’s father is Asian Games gold medalist Wang Ruiji, while his mother, Sophia Chow, was a world champion gymnast. Born in Hong Kong and with sport in his blood, Wang chose fencing, his prowess with the sabre eventually earning him a scholarship to Stanford University. He turned it down, choosing instead to venture to Seoul, South Korea, in 2011 to start training for K-pop superstardom.

For a while it looked like a grave mistake, with his two-and-a-half-year stint as a trainee at JYP Entertainment (also home to bands such as DAY6 and ITZY) constantly revolving around eliminations that would have seen him return home. But in the end, he was one of the seven people to make it into boyband GOT7, who have since established themselves as one of K-pop's biggest acts thanks to 12 number-one albums on Korea’s Gaon chart and arena world tours.

But Wang isn’t here to talk K-pop. He’s here to talk about his burgeoning solo career, one that he fosters via his own company, Team Wang. After a handful of solo singles in China, 2019’s mainly English-language debut album Mirrors (160m streams worldwide and counting) showcased a fusion of hip-hop bravado, R&B balladry and, as hinted at with 2018’s Fendiman, a love for one specific luxury Italian brand. In March 2020, Wang shared the more dance-leaning 100 Ways, complete with a typically spectacular video involving medieval garb, a lot of dry ice and some ferocious dancing.

Like everyone else, Wang has been stuck inside during the Covid-19 pandemic. But unlike many of us, he’s been ignoring the urge to binge eat, watch old boxsets, or have an existential crisis. Instead, Wang’s isolation includes creating more music, being philosophical and spreading perhaps the world’s most-needed resource right now: love. We spoke to him from his home in Seoul about music, fashion and overcoming expectations.

How have you been spending your lockdown?

“Every single day, I’ve been in the studio. I've been almost living there for the past two weeks, just recording song after song. I'm married to the studio right now — working is my wife.”

Is there anything you've learned about yourself during this time?

“I learned it’s important to do what we love every day. And to treasure it. You never know what could happen tomorrow, things could get worse. Do what you love and go after your dreams. Don't regret it. Don’t hesitate. The best thing for me to do right now is to continue to make more music and hopefully it can bring some joy to people during this hard time. Music is an international language and it's something that can connect people.”

What do you make of the narrative around the reporting of coronavirus? Have you had any negative experiences yourself?

“As you know, every country’s media is different, so I don't have much to comment about that. I just hope Earth fights through it together — everyone on this planet is one race right now.”

Do you have a message for your fans during this difficult time?

“I hope I can at least give them a little bit of joy and give them a reason to smile through my new music.”

Does that mean you're releasing new music soon?

“I'm preparing for my next album, which will be out this year. Every album I release I find out more about myself, my true colours and flavour in music. It's a part of my evolution. I feel like the next album is probably going to be another stage in my life.”

Is your latest single, 100 Ways, the first taste of the album?

OK… So it might be part of the album, but also it might not be?

The video for 100 Ways is incredible. Are you involved in that side of things?

“Let me explain the whole concept: there are a lot of elements in life we can't control, time and love are two of them. The reason I chose an ancient Chinese love story as the theme is because, first of all, I'm Chinese, and I love sharing my culture as much as I love learning about other cultures. Basically in the video, I’m this warrior and I come back to life to find my true love and bring her back to life so that I can tell her we should be together forever. We choose to be together and return to the afterlife after having conquered time. We only had two or three days to create everything from scratch, so it was very challenging. But in the end, we pulled off this masterpiece.”

Does your fencing background come in handy when it comes to choreography and training on video shoots?

“Fencing has helped me throughout my whole journey towards my dream. The reflexes, the mindset, the vision and me as an athlete. I never let stuff get in my way, or Team Wang’s way. There is going to be a lot of negativity along the journey, a lot of obstacles and people trying to pull us down, but nothing is easy. As long as I stay focused on sharpening my vision, I feel like we're going to make it.”

100 Ways is part of a new collaboration with hugely influential music entertainment company 88Rising — why did you want to team up with them?

“We all started as friends. And we have the same vision. We were having conversations as friends and [us working together] just came up naturally. In some ways people will be like, 'Oh you guys are partnering, blah blah blah.’ But at the end of the day, it’s 95 per cent about friendship.”

100 Ways is a little more dance-pop than the songs on Mirrors. Was it a conscious decision to move away from the hip-hop sound of that debut?

“No, it’s because I did a lot of hip-hop tracks and then I also did a lot of R&B stuff in China, but as I mentioned every time I release something new, I'm looking to evolve. I'm in the middle of trying to find my flavour still, and I'm trying to find my true self. I wouldn't say I'm there yet, but I'm definitely on the path.”

My favourite song on Mirrors is Bad Back where you mention Fendi, and obviously you have a song from 2018 called Fendiman…

“Whoo! Wait! Not a lot of people mention Bad Back, honestly. It's always Titanic, it's always Bullet To the Heart, it's always I Love You 3000, it's always Dway! — it's very rare. I just don’t hear a lot of people talking about Bad Back.”

Well, I’m ahead of the curve, clearly. Why were you so drawn to Fendi in particular?

“We became friends first through Fendi China. Then we talked. It just feels like our vision is very similar; we’re always trying to stay true to ourselves and not follow the trend. Personal style is important to me. It really defines someone’s character and their personality.”

What statement did you want to make with Mirrors?

“It’s eight different feelings over eight different tracks. It’s all about love. It can drive us crazy, it makes us happy, it messes with our emotions, but it’s so powerful. It can overcome everything. I feel that. It's like magic — you can’t freaking stop it. Emotions are like a spell. Basically, we should love more.”

Are you more comfortable as a singer now than as a rapper?

“No, I wouldn’t say that. I’m a performer. I’m a dancer, singer, rapper, you name it. It doesn’t really matter. I do whatever I love. I feel like it’s important when I do music, or when I do anything, I have to love it. If I don’t love it, no one else will. I have to have that passion.”

You've broken so many records for Chinese artists, particularly in the US — do you see yourself as a figurehead in the global crossover for Chinese music?

“I would say no. I don’t think I’m this icon. I don’t think I’m anything. I’m just this Chinese kid, Asian kid, just going after my dream. I’m just trying to make history for me and my people.”

So what's coming next for Jackson Wang?

“Within this year, my full album is coming out.”

Jackson Wang’s latest single, 100 Ways, is out now.

Read on!

When it comes to beauty and skincare, K-beauty or Korean beauty is ALL the rage right now. It is extensive and involves more than 10-steps to it. But seems like this is working wonders for it helps achieve clean, smooth and glassy skin. A clear, radiant complexion and a healthy make-up free, natural look are more things to look forward to when one practices the Korean skincare routine.

But seems like not everybody's routine involves the lengthy 10-step process. TWICE singer Momo Hirai commonly known as Momo, has quite a simple routine that seems like it can be followed by literally anybody! The Japanese singer based in South Korea revealed her simple and fuss-free skin care routine has just a basic couple of steps literally everybody can recreate. Read on to find out how she gets her flawless and glassy skin!

To begin with, Momo says to Allure, "Every day is different" because of her hectic schedule.

First, the K-POP star begins with a simple cleanser to take off her makeup and grime. But she makes sure not to wash her face for too long too! "I always keep a small timer next to me to tell me how many seconds I have to wash each part of my face," she singer told Harper's Bazaar.

After patting her face dry, Momo wipes her face clean with a toner on a cotton pad that makes for an all-in one. Her toner gives her a bright complexion, smoothens out her skin and gets rid of the remaining dirt.

Post that, Momo believes in the simplest thing to put on her face before she heads to bed - lotion.

And when she does have extra time on her hands, Momo chooses to add on a sleeping mask as her last step since it ensures hydration all night long and gets rid of that early-morning redness and puffiness.

This year was meant to be stellar for Seoul-based Big Hit Entertainment. Last year was its best ever, with record sales and profits, and an IPO in the works. Then came Covid-19, and with it, the biggest challenge yet to face the company’s founder Bang Si-hyuk.

Big Hit’s rise is due almost entirely on the mega-success of its K-Pop group BTS. In 2019, the seven-member act scored three No. 1 albums on the U.S. Billboard 200—the first band to achieve that feat in a quarter century. Last July, BTS became Asia’s highest earning band before taxes on the Forbes Celebrity 100 (and the third-highest worldwide). The band’s eight-month Love Yourself World Tour, which ended in October, reportedly pulled in over $196 million.

But now the future of live events—a major revenue driver—has been thrown into limbo. As Forbes Asia went to print, all of Big Hit concerts were being rescheduled, according to a company spokesperson, and the firm had also stopped selling tickets on its site. The tickets already sold for Big Hit’s April concerts in South Korea have been refunded; the spokesperson says Big Hit is looking to secure new dates and venues.

“Big Hit’s business will see a huge impact due to the virus,” says analyst Yoo Sung-man of Hyundai Motor Securities. Last year Big Hit earned $63 million (72.4 billion won) on a record $507 million in revenue, up more than 160% since 2018. But Yoo has slashed his earlier forecast of $616 million revenue this year to a mere $277 million. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Yoo’s downgrade.

The lack of live events now makes the firm’s digital strategy especially critical. But here is where Big Hit excels—its social media strategy changed the way all K-Pop bands, commonly known as idol groups, are marketed, and what arguably turned BTS into a global phenomenon. Much of the credit goes to Big Hit’s 42-year-old co-CEO Yoon Suk-jun, known as Lenzo, who gave a rare interview to Forbes Asia in Seoul prior to the pandemic (Bang and the BTS’ members declined to be interviewed for this story).

Yoon launched BTS’ social media strategy well before the band’s official debut in 2013. The company drew fans to the seven members by opening up their lives on sites such as Twitter and YouTube. Candid videos capturing ordinary moments—rehearsing at the studio, celebrating birthdays, exercising and eating dinner—went on to garner hundreds of millions of views. “BTS were influencers before celebrities knew they had to be influencers,” says Forbes contributor Tamar Herman, who covers international music and has written a book on BTS, slated for release in August.

An early BTS clip from 2013 shows the band’s leader, who goes by the stage name RM, in a studio at midnight. He says to the camera: “To be honest, I’m cold, I’m hungry and I’m sleepy—I just want to go home.” Videos like these made BTS more relatable to fans. “K-Pop fans are multilayered. It’s not that they simply like the music or lyrics. It’s as if they’re dating the artists,” says Yoon. “We focused on creating strong content, such as the clips we uploaded on YouTube. Now everyone’s doing it but Big Hit did this seven years ago. We were the pioneers.”

Bang Si-hyuk, nicknamed Hitman, started Big Hit Entertainment in 2005 after working as a composer for JYP Entertainment, one of Korea’s top three music agencies. After a rocky start, Big Hit enjoyed early success with 8Eight, a vocal group trio and 2AM, a four-member boy band it co-managed with JYP. In 2010, Bang signed BTS’ first member RM, then a 15-year old rapper in Korea’s underground hip-hop scene. Yoon, who became co-CEO with Bang last year, also joined Big Hit in 2010. Three years later, BTS debuted with its lead single, “No More Dream,” a hip-hop number about following your dreams. While the group started to gain popularity, its earlier years weren’t without stumbles. The group’s initial hip-hop image—with Afros, bling and bandanas—didn’t grab mainstream America the way that they had hoped. “Some thought they were trying too hard,” says Colette Bennett, a BTS fan and e-commerce editor at U.S.-based site Daily Dot.

As the group polished its image, songs became catchier and explored issues such as school bullying, mental health, and even politics—a departure from K-Pop’s more common themes of love and dancing. “They show so much of themselves to us,” says long-time fan Jiye Kim, 26, a Korean-Australian in Sydney. The group’s social media clout is a testament to Yoon’s early insight: BTS’ Twitter account boasts 19 million followers; its Instagram, 24 million followers. BTS’ YouTube channel has 28 million subscribers, with its most popular music video, “DNA,” having been viewed 960 million times. In 2017, BTS won Billboard’s Top Social Artist award, which is based on a vote among fans. The following year BTS made Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list.

But Bang, 47, is now grappling with Big Hit’s biggest weakness. “Nearly all of its income is coming from BTS,” says Hyungyong Kim, an equity analyst at Seoul-based eBest Securities. While the “big three” K-Pop agencies field dozens of acts, Big Hit has just four.

The firm faces another hurdle: BTS’ oldest member Kim Seok-jin, 27, is due to start South Korea’s mandatory 18-month military service next year. When that happens, Bang and Yoon may launch some members into solo acts—a common practice for agencies that have faced similar transitions. There are some workarounds. “Content can be released while members are in the army, as long as it was clearly produced prior to enlisting,” says Herman. However, all seven members renewed their contract with Big Hit for another seven years late last year.

Yoon says BTS’ success is sustainable. “I don’t think artists lose their market value because of age. Look at U2, they’re old but did they lose value?” he asks. “When the [BTS] artists reach their 30s, I believe they’ll be able to send a different kind of message or inspiration that’s relevant to those years. When they reach their 50s, it will be different and so on.”

That said, Bang and Yoon have already started diversifying and expanded the firm’s roster to include a new five-member boy band, Tomorrow X Together. The band is enjoying some early success, landing multiple entries on Billboard’s World Albums chart. In June, Big Hit acquired Seoul-based Source Music, including its six-member girl group GFriend. It has also embarked on a joint venture with CJ E&M—the backers behind the Oscar-winning film Parasite—which aims to field a new K-Pop boy band this year.

To find new revenue streams, Big Hit created a tech division that last June launched an app, Weverse, for its global fan base. “The Weverse app presents a lot of opportunities,” says Forbes contributor and Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin, who covers the K-Pop industry. The app, which has 7 million users, sells branded merchandise and monetizes concerts and long-form videos. In the community section, artists can communicate directly with fans. Bang has also been quoted as saying Big Hit can mine Weverse user data for insight. “We created Weverse to maximize communication with fans,” says Yoon.

Still, it’s unclear when BTS and other acts will be able to resume live events—which typically account for 40% of a K-pop agency’s revenue (Big Hit says it’s “difficult” to say how much concert tours bring in). One bright spot is China, a major live-event market, which is slowly returning to normal life—at least for now.

Then there’s the IPO. Big Hit had reportedly secured underwriters that included JPMorgan in February, and at one point, was valued as high as 5 trillion Korean won ($4.1 billion)—which may have made Bang, who currently owns 45% of Big Hit, a billionaire. But with the pandemic and one-seventh of Big Hit’s biggest asset slated for military service, the IPO’s outlook is murky.

Yet Big Hit has beaten the odds against much larger and established rivals. From 2016 to 2019, Big Hit’s sales grew more than 1,500% to $507 million, while net income jumped eightfold over the same period (see chart). Yoon says Big Hit’s success comes from putting the fans at the center of its business model. “Good songs are important, but what fans really care about is communicating with their artists,” he says. “Our fans are everything—I want to emphasize that. We are constantly asking. ‘How can we improve ourselves?’”Male K-pop idols on crop top are one of the hottest things every fan should see.

As the norm suggests, males do not normally wear one, yet when they defy such social standard; some turned out to be jaw-dropping visuals. Given that they usually slay in front of the crowd, there are definite male idols that are exceptionally on fire while fitting such clothes. Here are some of those who are burning with sexiness on a crop top.

Jin once flaunted his sexy waistline and astonished his fans. That grey colored crop top perfectly fitted him on his photoshoots.

Fans can't seem to let go of Wonho when several times, he allowed the mob to witness those abs hidden behind his angelic face. Whether it is black, white or red; he is slaying on a crop top.

Shinee's Taemin rocks with a crop top. His manly body couture adds to his sexiness when he wears one on stage. He never fails to make the mob go wow.

EXO lads are impressive visuals who sometimes perform shirtless. Nevertheless, when Sehun chose to dress on crop top; he nailed it. His masculine aura adds to his hotness.

TWICE Momo must be so lucky to not just having a funny boyfriend but a hot guy as well. Known with his immense sense of humor; he also made fans in awe when he wore a pink crop top to entertain her fans.

He is known for his well-defined abs, and when he wore a sexy black crop top, he definitely made the girls cry. Known for his hot covers on the magazine, Honseok is undeniably slaying among all.

Many times, Byeongkwan displayed his fit and fab body while on a crop top. However, his iconic leopard printed shirt took him to land a spot as one of the hottest Male KPOP idols on a crop top.

Being voted as one of the most loved KPOP idols to date, Kang Daniel is simply irresistible while on a crop top. Behind that cute smile is a man who will always make the stage burning on fire.

He did not just wear a crop top for he managed to give justice while flaunting that see-through, white, lacey, sexy shirt.

How many times did EXO Kai make the mob go "wow?" The group's dance machine not only possesses a fantastic dancing talent but, an oozing sex appeal. His crop top looks are way too hot to disregard.It is the singer’s very first album as a solo artist since debuting as a part of TVXQ back in 2003.

The album, featuring a total of six tracks, shows off the artist’s wide vocal range. Changmin participated in writing the lyrics for the title track “Chocolate” and “No Tomorrow.”

“Chocolate” is an addictive dance-pop that attempts to portray an intense desire one feels for their crush.

“No Tomorrow” is a folk-rock and a personal favorite of the artist. “I deeply love every track in the album, but if I had to pick one, it would be ‘No Tomorrow’ which I helped write the lyrics of,” he said on TVXQ’s YouTube channel.

“Lie” is an easy-listening pop with simple instrumentals and trendy beats. It also features singer Chungha whose voice harmonizes well with the TVXQ member, and depicts emotions exchanged between a couple who feels love in different intensities.

The album also includes “High Heels” that highlights groovy tunes, an R&B track “Me, Myself & I” and “Piano.”

Globally renowned producer Thomas Troelsen who recently worked with Selena Gomez and Dua Lipa and composer Ian Kirkpatrick participated in the making of the album as well as Yoo Young-jin, Hwang Yoo-bin and Seo Ji-eum.

TVXQ debuted as a male quintet in 2003 under S.M. Entertainment and immediately rose to fame, producing numerous hits. In 2010, three members left the group to form a separate trio, JYJ. Changmin and Yunho have continued the team as a duo.On April 13, Twice's official YouTube channel released the first trailer for Twice: Seize the Light, a YouTube Originals documentary series that allows fans to follow as they embark on the North American dates of last year's Twicelights Tour.

No Instagram, onde conta com 11,9 milhões de seguidores, Kim Jae-joong fez uma publicação onde dizia ter contraído covid-19. O cantor revelou ainda que se encontrava hospitalizado a receber tratamento para o vírus, adiantando que tinha ignorado as recomendações do Governo sul-coreano e pedindo perdão às pessoas que pudesse ter infectado.

Vários grupos de fãs de k-pop expressaram mensagens de apoio ao artista, uma das maiores celebridades da música sul-coreana, mas tudo não passava de uma partida de 1 de Abril.

Uma hora depois da publicação original – e já depois de a ter apagado –, o cantor confessou num novo post que tinha sido uma brincadeira, alegando que queria consciencializar as pessoas para a pandemia. O apoio e carinho demonstrado pelos fãs após o anúncio transformaram-se em descontentamento, com várias pessoas a criticar a atitude do artista nos comentários.

Kim Jae-joong afirmou que aceitará “todos os castigos” que resultem da brincadeira. A Coreia do Sul foi um dos primeiros locais seriamente afectados pela epidemia, contabilizando, esta quarta-feira, 9887 casos de infecção e 165 mortes.

Nos últimos dias, os governos de alguns países, como forma de evitar ao máximo a desinformação sobre o vírus, anunciaram fortes punições para quem fizesse as tradicionais brincadeiras do Dia das Mentiras sobre a covid-19. No caso da Tailândia, a pena pode ir até cinco anos de prisão. Em Taiwan, a multa pode chegar aos 90 mil euros e a pena de prisão até aos três anos.

A Google, empresa que anualmente faz paródias específicas para esta data, decidiu não realizar qualquer piada este ano. Num email interno enviado aos responsáveis, era pedida contenção nesta fase sensível, relembrando o dever de ser “útil” às pessoas que procuram informação fidedigna.Monsta X label mates Cravity are the latest K-pop band to debut, and they are already making waves with a hit EP and music video that has already been seen four million times.

The languages blur together so seamlessly over the skittish percussion that it’s hard to tell whether you understand everything, or none of it at all. That ambiguity continues as one of the many faces of the music collective is shown training among a group of men for a sporting event: sped-up monkey bar squats and hallway sprints, the air thick with masculinity and brotherhood. Then, the music takes a turn towards ambient jazz, with a final shot of Omega Sapien crashing into oncoming waves as everything fades to black. If it sounds like a lot, that’s because it is.

Balming Tiger pulled their name from the popular Tiger Balm, a centuries-old ointment that has become not only a pain-relieving staple in households across the globe but a symbol of Asia’s global influence. It’s this wide-spread, cross-cultural impact that Balming Tiger wanted to tap into when they formed the collective in 2018. The Seoul-based group currently consists of nine members: Omega Sapien, Sogumm, Unsinkable, wnjn, Mudd the Student, San Yawn, Abyss, Henson Hwang, and Jan’Qui. Charged raps blend with sultry vocals resulting in an eclectic mix of energy-raising and reflective beats.

In the past year, the group has grown an equally diverse fanbase, ranging from K-pop idols to teens across Europe and the States. Part of that is due to the recent #hakunamatatachallenge, which was started by dance studio Only ForwarD as a way to fundraise for their COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Whether anyone knows the meaning of the words playing in the background while they dance seems to be irrelevant. There’s a shared excitement not only for the collective good being done -- each post created translates to 5,000 won (roughly £3.50) donated -- but for the permission to let loose, as the energetic track openly calls for.

Their 2019 track “Armadillo,” a playfully chopped and screwed tune boosted by swinging camera shots, earned them Music Video of the Year at the 2020 Korean Hip-Hop Awards. Last month, Vans released an exclusive BT-illustrated sneaker, just weeks after it was announced that “Kolo Kolo” was nominated by the Berlin Music Video Awards for its hypnotic visuals too. They were set to play a slew of festivals around the world before the pandemic took hold

If the timing of the viral challenge suggests anything, it’s that Balming Tiger is here to stay on our radar. We caught up with the group to learn more about lifting inspiration from a studio session gone wrong and what they’re working on next.

Several K-pop stars have recently shown “Kolo Kolo” love with the #hakunamatatachallenge, first Hyun Ah and Dawn, then a week later Sandara Park. What inspired the now-viral track?

"Kolo Kolo" is a Korean onomatopoeia word that literally means “to cough up”. When we were working on the song in 2019, our producer, Unsinkable, wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t stop coughing. San had a hard time mixing the beat over it, so eventually he said to him ‘Why don't we just keep your coughing in this song and name it "Kolo Kolo"?’ and the rest was history. The track was completed long before coronavirus spread around the world but, in a twist of events, it’s now being used to do good.

Another thing that stands out about “Kolo Kolo” is the constant swapping of different languages. How did that come about?

Omega Sapien, who wrote the lyrics, is a third culture kid who has lived in Korea, China, the United States, and Japan. We think that his first couple of bars reflect the type of stateless art that we pursue.

It definitely feels unbound by any construct -- be they state lines or genre. What does the group think about the global expansion of K-pop? 

K-pop is more of a cultural phenomenon than a music genre; there are so many musical genres and various subcultures within the K-pop category. Many fusion and alternative groups are emerging in Korea, like those who want to merge BTS’s heart with Aphex Twin’s head.

One of the characteristics of Koreans and K-pop is that both quickly accept and digest new things. And it’s this sensitivity to trends that has led numerous young artists to incorporate the new into the old, hence bringing out different forms, concepts, music or art that never existed before. We grew up with Flying Lotus and Girls’ Generation. Now, with the global demand for K-pop, we’ve been given an opportunity to reach people around the world with music birthed from our own hybrid experiences.

How would Balming Tiger classify its discography?

We’d like to be seen as a “multi-national alternative K-pop band,” which is challenging in terms of what genre that actually is, but that’s intentional. Our members don’t want to be limited or defined by one specific genre. As all people do, we’re constantly changing what we want to consume, hear, and produce based on what we’re living at the moment. And what it comes down to is us wanting to make music that we can play in front of others without regret. Music that ties us together and quenches our thirst.

You must be pretty pleased with the success of “Armadillo”!

It’s always a great honour to be recognised and awarded. We think it reflects that there is love for us and, at the same time, that we do inspire people. We created Balming Tiger as a platform to introduce young and independent artists who weren’t getting recognised to the world market. For artists or groups like us, we need that genuine understanding, feedback, and support to thrive. Luckily, we have people’s attention now and their support will be our greatest strength when we progress forward.

Let’s talk about the support coming from brands, notably Vans. How did that collaboration come about?

We’ve had a good relationship with Vans since our early days. We initially collaborated with them on the production of “Icy”. Then in 2019, we performed at the House of Vans party and were asked to judge their annual ‘Musicians Wanted’ competition. They seem to think that our young and creative identity goes well with their brand mission. For the sneakers, each of our members took turns drawing animals and objects that best represented themselves. The mix -- a frog, SP404, and a mother figure, to name a few -- came from a list of abstract feelings that we wanted to communicate: ambition, sexual desire, energy, peace, and love.

There’s this constant exchange between illustration and music, from the Vans collaboration to your own comic series. Can you tell us more about the latter?

We release a comic for each song, which might be one of the most significant differences between our group and others. We think they’re the best way to express human fantasy. And doesn’t everyone love cute, funny stories? We wanted to make sure that element was incorporated into all of our art.

It seems like the best bet is to expect the unexpected, but what’s next for Balming Tiger?

We’ll continue to explore new and non-existent art and fun ways to deliver it to people. This year, some members will release solo projects, with Omega Sapien first. Dropping in May, his EP is both a personal story but also an attempt to capture all the ideals we’ve mentioned earlier. As an Asian, as a third culture kid raised in various countries, as a person in his 20s, as a K-Pop artist, as a human being living in the 21st century, as being a part of nature, he tried to capture every point of view. Mudd the Student, our newest member, will release his album in June shortly after. This all leads up to a compilation album, which we’ll debut towards the end of 2020. For the album, we wanted to create a sound that has never existed, a piece of original music that will be difficult to define.SEOUL (THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Only a day after being cleared of punishment for unpaid damages by a court, singer-turned-actor Park Yoo-chun has raised eyebrows again, this time for his untimely meeting with a South Korean governor.

On Thursday (April 23), Park gave an official explanation for his private appointment earlier that day with Mr Ahn Byung-yong, mayor of Uijeongbu city in Gyeonggi province, saying that the meeting was a courtesy call.

"Today's meeting with the mayor was arranged, thanks to the connection between the mayor and my long-time manager," Park posted on his social media account.

"The mayor gave me words of encouragement and genuine advice on life. He also told me to accept my past mistakes and to lead a life volunteering for society and working to help better the lives of socially disadvantaged people, with a sincerely regretful heart," he added.

The 33-year-old released the statement as the meeting had sparked off controversy.

On Wednesday, Park attended his detention judgment trial at Uijeongbu District Court for allegedly failing to pay damages to one of the four women who had accused him of sexual assault.

A detention judgment trial is held when the debtor does not attend an appointment for property elucidation or refuses to submit his or her property list.

In September last year, the Mediation Centre of Seoul Court confirmed its order for Park to pay a compensation of 50 million won (S$57,886) to the woman who had filed a suit.

The court in Uijeongbu decided on Wednesday that there would be "no punishment" for Park, which typically means either the punishment is unjust or the debtor has fulfilled his duties until the trial date.

Park's meeting with mayor Ahn raised public eyebrows as the member of boy band JYJ has been showing signs of resuming his career, despite pledging to retire from the entertainment industry amid a drug scandal last year.

Local media outlets reported that government officials at Uijeongbu City said they were not aware why the mayor had met Park and what was discussed between the two.April 8 this year marks what would've been SHINee member and solo artist Jonghyun's 30th birthday. The idol was a prolific songwriter, as well as being a powerful performer whose vocals commanded your attention.

His way with words and melodies is just one of the reasons we can never forget him and his impact on K-pop. Not only did Jonghyun write all of his solo songs himself, and produce most of them, he was also an incredible songwriter for other artists.

During his career he wrote songs for SHINee and his solo work, but also contributed to albums from Taemin, Lee Hi and EXO.

Here's just some of the songs you may not have known were originally written by him.

While Jonghyun may no longer be with us, his legacy endures through the incredible music he gifted us.

(2014), Shine or Go Crazy (2015), Come Back Mister (2016and A Korean Odyssey (20172018), dan Love With Flaws (2020).LOS ANGELES, April 1 (UPI) -- American K-pop star AleXa, who's promoting her latest single as a soloist on South Korean music shows, drops her first mini-album, Do or Die, on Wednesday.

The 23-year-old Korean-American singer is still in disbelief over her journey from Tulsa, Okla., to Seoul, where she has signed with a major music video production company.

"How do I make sense of it all?" AleXa, whose real name is Alex Christine Schneiderman, told UPI in a recent phone interview. "Honestly, I still have not made sense of it all yet.

"Every now and then, I'll just wake up and be like, 'How did I get here? What am I doing?' in a positive, reflective way. Cause it's very surreal to me that this is my life now cause this is something I've always wanted and strived for in my youth."

Before she became AleXa, starring in videos as an AI warrior, she was a fan of the K-pop group SHINee -- and fantasized about becoming an idol. Being a show choir singer and dancer, watching K-pop stars' performances, motivated her to pursue her dreams seriously while in high school.

Her first step was participating in "Rising Legends," a fan-voted online audition contest for international K-pop star hopefuls by the English-language Korean entertainment news site Soompi and the Korean company JYP Entertainment in 2016. She won first place in the dance category.

The following year, Soompi teamed up with Cube Entertainment, and at age 20, she tried once more. She ultimately won the grand prize: a trip to South Korea for a private audition with Cube.

Before the audition, AleXa flew to Seoul early after agreeing to shoot a reality TV show with Viki, an American streaming site for Asian shows and movies, that would follow her journey leading up to the big event.

Though she ultimately didn't make it into the company, Zanybros, a South Korean video production company that has worked with those in the industry like Pentagon, KARD, CLC and BTS, offered to sign her as its first trainee under subsidiary company ZB Label.

'This is your time'

Then a college student, AleXa faced a difficult decision about her future -- and she also had to convince her parents.

"It took a long while to discuss things with them, but I think at this point my parents were fully supportive of my dream. They were more or less like, 'This is your time to do what you want. You don't want to look back on this and regret not taking this opportunity,'" she said.

Soon thereafter, AleXa signed with ZB Label, which sent her to compete on the reality competition show Produce 48.

"It was a scary decision because I was on that path to proper adulthood. But I think I definitely would have regretted it had I not taken this opportunity," she said.

She didn't make it far in the show, but following her exit, the label rapidly began her training to become AleXa.

"It's definitely very, very exciting to be the first-born artist from Zanybros, of all companies," she said. "It's really wild because they're one of the biggest, if not the absolute biggest, video production company here in South Korea.

"So the fact that they had interest in signing me and have now developed me as an artist is both very exciting but also quite scary, because there are expectations you have to live up to, and I don't want to disappoint anybody in this company."

AleXa made her big debut in October with "Bomb," characterized by an emphasis on strong choreography for the Afrobeats-tinged song and a "warrior-style girl crush" concept, as she described it.

The follow-up, "Do Or Die," picks up where its predecessor left off plot wise in the dystopian fictional universe. It's a Brazilian funk-lite and EDM hybrid that also features her signature powerful choreography.

Since the concept is that she's an AI that exists within a multiverse, AleXa discussed whether she would carry on the same narrative throughout her career.

"Right now in 'Bomb,' 'Do Or Die,' and soon the third chapter in the trilogy, she's this hard-hitting cyberwarrior character. It's very cyberpunk. But the thing is, in a different universe, she could be a soft high school girl or something," she said. "This trilogy alone will be this hard-hitting thing. It's not gonna keep repeating itself."

Creatively, though being backed up by a production powerhouse that handles most aspects of her music and career, AleXa said she's grateful she's able to be a part of the process.

"Because of my actual love for horror movies and sci-fi, I get a big say in the concepts and what the music videos might be," she said. "I also get to approve the styling. We'll look at things together and be like, 'Do you think this will work for the concept? Do you think this will look good on you?'"

As different K-pop artists continue to make inroads in the U.S. music market, that gives AleXa hope.

"It's so cool [that] nowadays K-pop is mainstream news. Cause back when I was a K-pop fan, people would look at me weird for watching these music videos, being a fan of 'Asian music,'" she said.

"But, did we not just have 'Despacito' blow up in America? I'm pretty sure not everyone speaks Spanish. Music is something that transcends language. So the fact that [K-pop] has become something that people are more open-minded about and is comfortably publicly spoken about is amazing to me."

In March, AleXa signed with ICM Partners to focus on the U.S. market as a singer, actor and performer. On Wednesday, she'll be releasing her first EP, Do Or Die. The mini album will include eight tracks, including "Bomb" and "Do Or Die."It’s common knowledge by that TWICE, JYP Entertainment’s nine-member girl group, was formed on the 2015 reality show Sixteen. But how were TWICE’s members discovered before that? Like many K-pop stars, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu could’ve had different careers if they didn’t become members of one of the most popular K-pop girl groups ever.

But before we discuss what the lives of TWICE’s members were like before they became JYP Entertainment trainees, let’s recap how TWICE came to be: In 2015, a South Korean reality series, titled Sixteen, pitted 16 JYP Entertainment trainees against each other for seven spots in the entertainment company’s next girl group. Each week, the contestants competed against each other before...
• There's a new meme on Twitter that involves juxtaposing a character or public figure's torso alongside a pair of legs wearing thigh-high boots.
• The legs in question belong to Lisa, a member of K-pop girl group Blackpink.
• People are using various screencaps of her legs from a recent dance performance video to spice up characters like Spock or Captain America.

Step aside — there's a new pair of perfect legs in town and they're dominating the Twitter meme cycle. A recent meme has catapulted a pair of thigh-high-adorned legs into Twitter stardom by juxtaposing them against a variety of torsos, making it appear as if people like the late Leonard Nimoy's Spock or animated character Bojack Horseman are sporting some new, out-of-character limbs.

The legs in question belong to Lisa, a member of K-pop girl group Blackpink, who performed at Coachella in 2019 and is set to appear on a track on Lady Gaga's upcoming "Chromatica." The youngest member (23), a rapper, and main dancer in the group, Lisa is known for her electric dance performances: a fancam of her performing a dance cover to Jason Derulo's "Swalla" at a Blackpink concert has over 8 million views on YouTube, and one Twitter video of the performance has nearly 10 million. These particular photos of Lisa's legs are screencaps from a video released on April 20 in which she dances to "Mushroom Chocolate" by QUIN and 6LACK.

Between the thigh-high boots, black shorts, and neutral background, the legs have been a hit across Twitter. While there are certain screencaps of the video that are used more frequently in memes — notably, those in which Lisa is laying on the ground — people have been getting creative in order to get her legs to mash-up with their favorite personalities or characters. Some of the most viral involve characters whose nature unexpectedly vibes with Lisa's legs (we see you, Luigi).Others look contemplative and cool with a pair of neat thigh-highs.

Some celebs got in on the action, memeing themselves with a pair of Lisa's legs. Some pulled it off better than others.

Some brought in pairs of characters, like Captain America and Spider-Man from the MCU or Jon Hamm and Paul Chahidi as Gabriel and Sandalphon in "Good Omens," mixing up the shots of Lisa's legs in the process.

As the meme began to circulate more, however, people started relying on the legs' notoriety online, posting nonsensical and absurd combinations of images that were just as funny as the original memes themselves. For example, one features a recent headline from The Verge that reads, "Elon Musk says shelter-in-place orders during COVID-19 are 'fascist.'"

• Fans reacted with support and love following reporters that K-pop idol Chen, of EXO, welcomed his first child into the world
• A mysterious fake K-pop girl group fooled fans for days, and this isn't the first time it's happened

Of course, the set wouldn't be complete without memes featuring Lisa herself.Thank you Lisa, for giving the internet the gift of your existence, your dance skill, and your legs.Read the original article on InsiderWe know you’ve definitely been spending a lot of time these days mastering the art of ~throwing it back~ or ~hitting the whoa~ for your perfect TikTok dance video. We get it. We hear ya. But if you’re already busting out intricate choreo in your everyday life, one might assume that learning dance routines from le Tok would be…a breeze? The queens of K-pop girl group (G)I-DLE proved to us that getting a TikTok dance down *should* be something I could do with my eyes closed with our TikTok Challenge Challenge game.



Our girl Shuhua kicked it off and really didn’t look fazed at all. She was mirroring the moves James Charles was doing in his video as if she had already practiced it 15 times in the mirror at home. Ugh, a girl after my own heart.

Now, Minnie came in to conquer because WOW. Her practice round was good enough to perform at a stadium concert. By the time the actual challenge round came along, she had already known it so well that she was AHEAD of the music. Star quality right there, y’all. Soyeon came in right after with her game face, too, and was ready to compete. She was also able to effortlessly keep up and pretty much nailed the sequence in seconds.

Miyeon had a good start but ultimately had some trouble remembering some of the moves to her dance. But to be fair, hers was a lil trickier than the rest.

So Soojin and Yuqi were left with the really tough dances and they took them on like troopers!! They both executed them well, like true TikTokers, and Yuqi had one that required two people! As you can already tell, every gal rocked their choreo…but there can only be one winner! DUN. DUN. DUN. Any guesses?

E tão forte que ultrapassa as barreiras da indústria musical para mudar aspectos culturais na Coreia do Sul e no resto do mundo. Exemplo disso foi a sacudida que o gênero deu nos padrões de beleza masculina. Maquiagem, moda, acessórios, cuidados com a pele, padrões mais delicados, tudo isso se enquadra na chamada "masculinidade soft". Os jovens artistas conseguiram quebrar os limites de rótulos antigos como "metrossexual" (criado no começo dos anos 2000) e tornaram "natural" e aceitável o que até pouco tempo seria visto como efeminado, andrógino ou gay.

Quando apareceu em alguns programas de TV coreanos no início dos anos 1990, o cantor Yang Joon-il usava cabelos longos, brincos e ainda ousava incluir versos em inglês nas músicas. Foi repelido por crítica e público sem piedade. "Não tenho certeza se ele é uma mulher ou um homem", era um dos comentários mais comuns. Curiosamente, vinte anos antes David Bowie havia traçado caminhos para os ocidentais com seu glam rock carregado de androginia. "Rebel Rebel", canção de 1974, dizia: "Você deixou sua mãe confusa/ Ela não tem certeza se você é menino ou menina".

A aparência dos integrantes das boy bands de k-pop influencia cada vez mais a sociedade coreana. Aos olhos do Ocidente, pode parecer que os homens coreanos são mais femininos do que os de outras culturas, mas eles não se consideram assim. Visto do ponto de vista coreano, é apenas um padrão de beleza.

Hábitos e comportamentos encarados como coisas de mulher também vêm sendo redefinidos e encorajados na Coreia do Sul, coisas como o uso de maquiagem, esmalte nas unhas, tratamento de pele e liberdade com roupas e acessórios. "Na América, homens geralmente usam cores escuras, preto, cinza. Na Coreia é totalmente normal vermos homens usando cores brilhantes como rosa e azul claro", comenta Park Jihoon, professor da Korea University, ao site "Koreaboo".

Joanna Elfving-Hwang , da Universidade da Austrália Ocidental, que fez uma pesquisa sobre beleza e imagem na Coréia do Sul, chama a atenção para as possibilidades que as estrelas de k-pop abriram para os homens comuns. "Acho que a Coreia é pioneira na cultura de beleza masculina, definitivamente na Ásia no momento, se não no mundo. A maneira como os artistas brincam com a masculinidade, com o que significa ser um homem bonito de uma maneira heterossexual ou não-heterossexual, abre possibilidades para os homens nas ruas e, eventualmente, torna-os mais aceitáveis", disse a professora em uma entrevista à "BBC".BTS fans can look forward to watching past performances put up by their idols from the comfort of their home this weekend.

The South Korean boy band, one of the biggest acts in the world, announced on their official Twitter account that they would be streaming their past concerts on YouTube for free this weekend.

Called Bang Bang Con, the concert marathon will begin at noon on Saturday (April 18) - with their concerts from 2014 to 2016.

It will continue on Sunday, with their concerts including BTS 4th Muster (Happy Ever After) and BTS World Tour 'Love Yourself' Seoul.

In late February, BTS cancelled their four Seoul concerts that were originally scheduled in April, due to the rise in Covid-19 cases in South Korea.

In March, they postponed their North America tour by two months to June due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.

The seven-member boy band - comprising RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook - are the first K-pop group to top the charts in the United States and Britain.

They released their latest album, Map Of The Soul: 7, in February and have been teaching their fans the Korean language in a series of short videos on Weverse, their fan-community app.Following last year’s Burning Sun sex scandal, K-pop and Korean stars including Moon Ga-young, Junho and Yeonwoo all denounced the Telegram incident on their social media platformsSM Entertainment’s prized female quintet Red Velvet is back on top of the brand rankings this April!

Securing the second place is YG Entertainment’s femme fatale quartet BLACKPINK. Jennie, Jisoo, Rose, and Lisa obtained the high-rank thanks to their 4,472,516 brand reputation index.

Continuously impressing fans with their high ranking in the past several months, rising K-Pop girl group (G)I-DLE acquired the third spot this April. Soyeon, Soojin, Miyeon, Shuhua, Minnie, and Yuqi followed closely with a brand reputation index of 4,337,733.

TWICE and ITZY came in at fourth and fifth spots. Apink grabbed the sixth rank while Girls’ Generation placed seventh. Rounding up our top-ten list are LOONA, IZ*ONE, and MAMAMOO who took the eighth to tenth places, respectively.

Here are the other female idol groups who entered the Top 30 this April 2020:K-pop singer Goo Hara died of suicide at the age of 28 in November 2019. Today, her older brother continues to fight for justice on her behalf.

On Monday (April 6), Goo Ho In took to Instagram to voice his thoughts on Choi Jong Bum, his sister's former boyfriend.

Choi, a hairdresser, had physically assaulted the idol and blackmailed her with a sex tape in September 2018. He was found guilty of four charges - intimidation, assault, coercion and property damage - and received a three-year probation sentence in August 2019.

In September 2019, both the defence and prosecution filed for appeals and the case moved to a second trial, which is set to take place on May 21 this year.

In his post, Goo expressed his shock at Choi's lack of remorse, calling him out on "holding a grand opening party" since being released on probation.

"My family and many people who cherished and loved Hara are furious at Choi's shameless behaviour," Goo wrote, according to Korean entertainment news portal Soompi.

He also voiced his disapproval at the outcome of the first trial. "Unfortunately, the punishment for dating violence in our country is too lenient and weak when it comes to protecting the victim," Goo wrote.

"We sincerely hope that at least in the second trial, a just sentence will be served to the person who committed a horrible crime, through wise ruling stemming from universal common sense and a sense of justice."

He also noted that the petition for the Goo Hara Act, which he started, has been forwarded to the Legislation and Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly.

The act aims to change current inheritance laws, which give parents of childless adults the right to inheritance even if they did not personally raise and provide for them. Goo managed to submit the petition to the National Assembly after it got 100,000 signatures from Korean citizens within 30 days.

The siblings were abandoned by their divorced parents when they were younger. Goo is currently in a legal dispute with his mother, who has demanded half of the late singer's inheritance. Their father has since given his 50 per cent share to his son. – The Straits Times/Asia News NetworkJung-eum tampil di variety show Love Letter selama dua tahun sebelum debut sebagai aktris di The Person I Love (2007).

Thanks to the power of “Stay Tonight”, fans are already left wondering how much more intense and powerful Chung Ha’s full comeback will actually be.South Korea has quickly become an epicenter for beauty trends around the world. It comes as little surprise, given the international appeal of K-pop and Korean skin care. But as for what sits atop the heads of South Koreans? That is evolving. According to hairstylist and salon owner Chahong, "People [are starting] to pay attention more an inner beauty, a minimal lifestyle, and self-reflection than following the trend for just an appearance." In the salon, this translates to low-maintenance cuts and hair colors that seem slightly worn in.

We spoke to Korean hairstylists and Song Yein, digital editor at Allure Korea, about the cuts, colors, and treatments folks are asking for right now.

Whether they’re going blonde or blue, clients tend to ask for ashy undertones. The cool shades complement the red and yellow tones in many Koreans’ complexions, says hairstylist Kim Sunwoo. They also cancel out the redness many Koreans naturally have in their dark hair so new shades can look more vibrant. "Bambi brown" is a color Chahong says is trending — and it just so happened to originate in her salons. "We put in a gray tone for a clear brown, then a chocolate brown [that looks like] Bambi's fur."The South Korean fashion icon and music superstar will celebrate her 31st birthday on April 18 – here’s everything you need to knowFrom their first EP, I Am, to their third and newest April release, I Trust, (G)I-dle have put out music that is bold and personal — a perk of having control over much of the creative process. Leader Soyeon runs point on most of their work, but other members contribute as well, like Thai member Minnie and Chinese member Yuqi. Their work has landed them awards back home and international attention during the two years they've been together. Their momentum is such that in March, the group had plans to embark on a 32-city tour, "I-Land: Who Am I", around the world, before it was postponed by the global pandemic.- Seorang idol K-Pop selain memiliki bakat menyanyi dan dance, kebanyakan juga mempunya talenta berakting.Jadi, tak ayal banyak idol K-Pop yang melebarkan kariernya hingga ke dunia akting dengan membintangi film atau drama.Namun, sebuah kabar tidak menyenangkan harus dialami oleh Viki eks personel girlband Dal Shabet.Niat ingin menjajal ranah film atau drama membuat Viki berhadapan dengan kejadian traumatis.Agensi yang menaungi Viki malah menjebloskannya bermain di sebuah film erotis pada tahun 2015 yang berjudul Nice Sister in Law."Aku pikir, jika tak menyetujui apa kata manajemen, aku bisa kehilangan kesempatan membintangi film. Sutradara bilang tak akan banyak adegan telanjang. Filmnya berakhir tanpa banyak adegan terbuka," ungkap Viki.Awalnya, agensi yang menaunginya itu meminta Viki beradegan ranjang tapi hanya menampilkan bagian punggung.Tapi ketika syuting dilaksanakan, ia malah ditipu karena benar-benar diminta untuk telanjang.Kru dan staf film tersebut hanya bisa diam mengikuti jalan produksi tanpa membelanya sedikit pun."Itulah saat mereka mulai mengambil adegan dewasa dengan menunjukkan posisi telanjang yang ekstrem. Dan saat itu tak ada satu pun yang membelaku di lokasi syuting," pungkasnya.Ia juga sedih dan terluka karena para penggemar mengenalnya bukan sebagai eks personel Dal Shabet tapi sebagai bintang porno.When it comes to mainstream Asian music, one of the most popular and most noted genres today is Korean Pop Music (K-Pop). And it’s not surprising, as K-Pop groups like BTS, EXO, and BLACKPINK continue to gain international fame–further highlighting the artistry and uniqueness.

Although K-Pop–in its own right–deserves to be recognized, there are a lot of well-written Asian songs that seem to be overshadowed by the music genre’s increasing popularity. That is why online user Lily Jin decided to create a Spotify playlist that features music from other Asian countries.

“K-Pop is super big right now, but I felt that other Asian music scenes were overlooked because of that. I wanted to make this playlist to highlight music from Asian countries that don’t get as much global attention. These countries have really great musical talent that I wanted to share with others,” she tells POP!

The Subtle Asian Bops playlist features songs from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Mongolia, China, Japan, and even the Philippines.

Moreover, the playlist is not only limited to pop music, but it also contains a variety of different genres.

“There’s a little bit of everything. There’s indie, alt, r&b, pop, hip hop, EDM. I normally listen to a variety of genres so it was just natural for me to include a mix of everything,” she explains.

She hopes this playlist can highlight the music of other countries and thrust it into the spotlight of the international music scene.

For those interested in listening to her song picks, you can do so by visiting the playlist on the music streaming platform. And to get you started on finding your next favorite tracks, Jin recommends the following songs: ‘4 AM’ by Bil Musa, ‘tere bina’ by Zaeden, ‘Slow Down’ by Taichi Mukai, ‘Curriculum Vitae’ by A. Nayaka, ‘Fighter’ by Prateek Kuhad, and ‘My Favorite Clothes’ by Rini.

Looks like we are having a problem on the server.Trolls World Tour is full of catchy earworms just like its predecessor - here's a breakdown of every song on the soundtrack. The film, which is just as glittery and fun as 2016's Trolls, takes place at some point after the events of original movie.

In Trolls World Tour, Poppy is happily ruling as queen of her tribe, with her best friend Branch at her side. Thanks to an invitation to Queen Barb's world tour, Poppy learns her tribe is just one of six Troll tribes - pop, rock, classical, funk, techno, and country. Each tribe has a string that represents their genre of music. Barb intends to steal the strings from each tribe to force all trolls to come together under her music: rock. Branch and Poppy set out to convince Barb to unite all music, instead of destroying what's different than hers.

As the film encompasses a wide variety of music genres, so does its soundtrack. Here's every song from Trolls World Tour that appears on the soundtrack.
• "One More Time" - Daft Punk: The Pop Trolls sing this song at a party. Queen Barb's entrance interrupts the song.
• "Rock You Like a Hurricane" - Scorpions: Barb sings this song as she drops in on the Pop Trolls' party and informs them of her plan to acquire each of the strings so she can rule over every Troll.
• "Trolls Just Want to Have Fun": The song is an ode to "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper. Poppy sings it as her intro to the movie, with a little help from Branch, as he sings about his feelings for Poppy. The song is mashed up with "Groove is In the Heart" by Deee-Lite and "Good Times" by Chic.
• "Born to Die" - Kelly Clarkson: Clarkson, who plays Delta Dawn in the film, sings this original song.
• "Crazy Train" - Ozzy Osborne: Barb sings the song after acquiring the Techno string.
• "Wannabe" - Spice Girls /"Who Let The Dogs Out" - Baha Men/"Good Vibrations" - Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch /"Gangham Style" - Psy /"Party Rock Anthem" - LMFAO: Determined to show the Country music Trolls that music should make you happy, Poppy, Branch and Biggie sing this medley to them.
• "Leaving the Lonesome Flats" - Dierks Bentley: The song plays over Branch, Poppy and Biggie's escape from jail.
• "I Fall to Pieces" - Patsy Cline: Hickory sings the song to Branch as he calls him out on his feelings for Poppy.
• "Atomic Dog" - George Clinton: The song briefly plays while Poppy, Branch and Hickory fly into Vibe City.

• "Russian Roulette" - Red Velvet/ "Mi Gente" - J. Balvin and Willy William: The K-Pop and Reggaeton Trolls sing this song to distract Branch before they kidnap him.
• "Barracuda"- Heart: Once she has all six strings in her possession, Barb sings this song so she can play her "ultimate power cord."
• "Just Sing" - Justin Timberlake: Every troll across each tribe comes together to sing this song.
• "The Other Side" - SZA and Justin Timberlake: The song plays over the final moments of the film.
• "Don't Slack" - Anderson .Paak and Justin Timberlake: This song plays as the film fades into the credits.
• "Rock N Roll Rules" - HAIM and Ludwig Göransson: The original song plays over the Trolls World Tour credits.

Unsurprisingly, given Trolls World Tour's cast is made up of musical artists or actors with a background in music, these songs are integral to the film, and will be earworms for all who listen. Music is an intrinsic part of the Trolls franchise, and that continues with the Trolls World Tour soundtrack.

More: Trolls World Tour Has The Same Plot Twist As Frozen 2Jakarta - Penggemar sepak bola datang dari berbagai dunia. Bahkan idol-idol K-pop juga termasuk kalangan yang ikut tergila-gila dengan sepak bola, kendati mereka sendiri juga banyak digilai para penggemar sedunia.

Setelah era boyband dari Eropa maupun Amerika Serikat pada era 1990-an hingga awal 2000-an, kini dunia menghadapi "serangan" boy group dan girl group dari Korea Selatan seiring gelombang Hallyu atau yang dikenal dengan istilah Korean Wave.

Korean Wave tak bisa dipisahkan dengan K-pop, yang merupakan genre musik populer dari Korea Selatan. Saat ini publik di Indonesia sudah tak asing dengan bintang-bintang K-pop.

Para anggota boy group dan girl group itu yang lantas mendapatkan julukan sebagai idol.

Di balik penampilan mereka yang terkesan "unyu-unyu", terpendam bakat lain. Tak hanya dikenal dengan skill menyanyi, nge-dance, atau akting, ada beberapa idol yang cinta dan juga hobi berat bermain sepak bola.

Mereka juga punya klub dan pemain idola, sering terbang hingga ke Eropa untuk menyaksikan langsung klub favorit bertanding, hingga suka mengenakan jersey klub dan pemain idola dalam keseharian.

Saking senangnya bermain bola, di antara mereka ada juga yang membentuk sebuah tim. Yang paling ternama mungkin adalah FC Men. Tim ini menjadi bagian dari klub K League 1, Suwon Samsung Bluewings.

Seperti halnya tim-tim sepak bola pada umumnya, member FC Men secara rutin menggelar latihan di sela-sela jadwal konser, pemotretan atau syuting.

FC Men bahkan pernah menantang tim selebritas Indonesia dalam laga ekshibisi di Jakarta pada November 2016.

Selain para idol yang tergabung dalam FC Men, ada pula beberapa idol lain yang diketahui memiliki skill oke dalam mengolah si kulit bundar, seperti halnya Chio Min-ho, member boy group Shinee.

Bahkan andai tak dilarang sang ayah, Min-ho mungkin akan jadi pesepak bola dan bukannya idol, karena ia sangat menyukai bermain sepak bola.

Ayah Min-ho, Choi Yun-kyum, merupakan mantan pemain Timnas Korea Selatan era 1980-an yang setelah gantung sepatu, berprofesi sebagai pelatih. Choi Yun-kyum tercatat pernah membesut Busan IPark, Gangwong FC, hingga klub ternama Vietnam, Hoang Anh Gia Lai.

Lalu, ada pula Leo, personel VIXX, yang pernah jadi bagian Timnas Korsel kelompok usia pada 2004-2007.

Nah, berikut deretan idol K-pop menunjukkan kecintaannya terhadap sepak bola melalui akun media sosial:"When you do exercise and have too much muscle.You can't make arm heart🤣Yo guys follow my tiktok ID is Manny1117😁," tulis Manny.Postingan itu langsung ramai dengan komentar penggemarnya.

What does BTS eat in a day? What are some of their favorite foods? Here’s what we know about these K-pop idols and their snacking habits.

What does BTS eat in a day?

These seven K-pop idols are hungry for more than just success. If you’ve watched any of BTS’ live streams, chances are, you’ve caught the boys snacking on something, whether that be a cake for someone’s birthday or just some noodles.

The oldest member of the boy band started his own mini “mukbang” series, titled Eat Jin, where the k-pop idol talks to fans while enjoying some food. During their interview on The Late Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, RM shared that in Korea, a typical late-night snack would include fried chicken and some beer. However, when J-14 spent the day with this K-pop group they found that it was filled with a lot of snacks.

“There were ramen cups, boxes of Pocky – which are thin chocolate-covered sticks – crunchy Cheetos and Fritos, cans of Coke, slices of cake, iced coffees, and ‘body conditioning’ shakes,” J-14 shares about the K-pop group.

What are some of BTS’ favorite restaurants?

During a few different interviews, the BTS members shared some of their favorite restaurants, both in America and back home. For J-Hope that means Shake Shack, (and maybe a chicken noodle soup with Sprite on the side.) For Suga and V that means Panda Express.

Of course, if BTS stopping on the West Coast, In-N-Out Burger. During one interview, the boys said that one of their favorite Korean restaurants is Yam Yam Chicken, comparing it to America’s Kentucky Fried Chicken.

“They revealed that they had tried Panda Express at the airport, but there was never full disclosure of what they actually thought of that meal… More Coke cans, yogurt-covered pretzels, Kind bars, and nacho cheese Doritos and hot dogs. FYI, the Doritos are Jimin’s favorite,” the J-14 article continues.

Don’t worry, though. These boys stay healthy with plenty of workouts, as seen from Twitter posts by the band members. They’re also always dancing, practicing for upcoming live performances and showcasing their talent on YouTube and social media.

BTS shared that their eating habits weren’t always healthy

It’s hard to know what goes on behind the scenes for this K-pop group. Some of the members have even opened up about unhealthy eating habits and diets to prepare for shows. When the members watched a video from when they first debuted, Jin and RM mentioned how they starved so much back then.

According to Metro, Jimin shared that he would sometimes lose consciousness during dance rehearsals from his dietary habits. This isn’t exactly out of the ordinary for K-pop groups, and the members have since acknowledged the dangers of extreme dieting.

Beloved K-pop star Kim Hee-chul, better known as Heechul, revealed Monday the moving reason why he has denied rumours that he’s gay.

Speaking on Love of 7.7 Billion alongside out South Korean gay actor and TV personality Hong Suk Chun, Heechul, a host of the JTBC show, described how he has often become tangled in rumours and speculations surrounding his sexuality.

“People who know this know, but in the early days of my debut, there were endless rumours that I was gay,” the Super Junior member, 36, said.

“I was even named in scandals with male celebrities. It’s because I had long hair and wore colour contact lenses in the early days of my debut.”

He continued: “At first, I wanted to deny that I was gay, but I felt that if I did, I could possibly disrespect sexual minorities.

“Whether it’s overseas or in the country, there could be a gay person among the male fans who come to our concerts.

“I thought that I would feel apologetic towards those fans.”

Not the first time Heechul has been pestered about his sexuality,

Heechul has, at times, stated that he’s saddened by the speculation that he is gay simply because of his appearance.

“I’m not gay,” he said to Yonhap News in 2017, IB Times reported, “I like women.

“But I realised that if I say I’m not and vehemently deny it, it’s rude and hurtful to people who are actually gay.

“It’s just a matter of preference, and it’s just that everyone is different with different values.”

He continued: “I decided I don’t care even if people who have prejudices about me think that way.”Not only is BTS the biggest boy band in the world, but they’re also one of the top social artists. It’s through Twitter posts and silly vlogs that fans catch a glimpse into the lives of these K-pop idols, returning the favor with thousands (if not millions) of retweets and likes.

How did they become so popular on social media without individual accounts? Here’s some reasoning behind the success.

BTS has a Twitter, Instagram, and even a TikTok account

This K-pop group has fans all over the world. What better way to connect than with social media? Since their debut, BTS earned over 24 million followers on Instagram and their Twitter account, with hundreds of millions of views on their YouTube videos. They even recently made a TikTok account, where they post silly videos from time to time.

Fans even have the chance to talk to the BTS members on the platform, Weverse, where the K-pop group shares personal posts and even videos for fans to learn Korean. It comes as a surprise to some, however, that BTS shares one Twitter account between the group’s seven members.

Although fans can potentially connect with BTS on Twitter and Weverse, the BTS members don’t have individual public accounts on Twitter or Instagram. This is a stark contrast to Western boy bands, including the Jonas Brothers.

What’s the reasoning behind this shared Twitter account? One website suggests, “BTS contradicts such a norm with their social media, as they have one collective, personal Twitter account for the seven members.

“The members began posting on this account even before their debut, allowing fans to truly become invested in them from the very beginning. Because BTS uses this shared-account format, fans have a single place where they can find entertaining content about their favorite group,” the article continues.

If you want proof of BTS’ social media success, turn to the Billboard Music Awards, where the K-pop group won the award for “Top Social Artist” three years in a row. They won the iHeartRadio Music Award for Best Fan Army two years in a row.

They even became the first K-pop group to present an award at the Grammy’s, performing a song with Lil Nas X live the next year. The CEO of BTS’ management company, Bang Si-Hyuk, commented on BTS’ success during an interview with Billboard. He said it has partially to do with social media and the accessibility of this group by fans across the globe.

“The experience of global citizens watching the same performance at the same time has been transformed now to one where we communicate real-time with anyone around the world, in our palms, through various channels,” Bang said (with English provided in real-time from an on-site translator).

Ever since their breakout performance at Coachella in 2019, the all-female K-Pop group, Blackpink, has made an indelible impression on a stateside audience — all at a time when Korean pop music has undoubtedly merged into the mainstream. So it's understandable that fans of Blackpink — commonly known as BLINKs — are in an uproar over the girl group's lack of a "comeback" in 2020, a term K-Pop fans commonly use to refer to the release of new material or a new tour.

Rather than directing their ire at the band (who, to be fair, have very little control over when their material is distributed or when their performances are scheduled), BLINKs have instead targeted Blackpink's agency and record label, YG Entertainment. And, honestly, there's a good chance that their anger isn't unwarranted.

So what's the deal with YG Entertainment? And why are BLINKs so angry at the management agency?Berdasarkan data Sirekap KPU, suara yang masuk sudah mencapai 58,5 persen dari total 4.451 TPS di 30 Kecamatan di Kabupaten Karawang.- Laman media Korea Selatan tengah dihebohkan dengan pemberitaan soal salah seorang anggota girlgroup K-Pop yang dikabarkan membawa kekasihnya saat konser di luar negeri.Melansir dari AllKpop, laporan dari 'Blind Item' kepada Newsen, seorang anggota girlgroup dengan inisial 'F' dikabarkan membawa kekasihnya dalam menghadiri jadwal grupnya di luar negeri awal tahun 2020 ini.Namun, di hari keberangkatan, kekasih 'F' lupa membawa paspor sehingga 'F' memaksa untuk tetap naik pesawat yang sama dengan kekasihnya dan membuat pihak agensi mengalami kesulitan.Pihak agensi akhirnya mengganti tiketnya sebanyak 13 kali dan hal itu membuat mereka harus membayar 10 kali lipat dari harga tiket aslinya.'F' juga dikabarkan tidak menghadiri acara gladi resik bersama anggota lainnya karena ia datang terlambat dan sempat mengunggah foto di lokasi eksotis.Hal itu membuat kesal pihak promotor dan karena perbuatan idol tersebut, girlgroup itu tak mendapat bayaran penuh karena dianggap telah melanggar kontrak kesepakatan kerja sama.
