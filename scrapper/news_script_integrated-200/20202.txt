Last fall, Malvo, an indie K-pop artist, was walking to the parking lot after a long day. He had just finished a show at a university festival near Seoul, South Korea. In the lot, a middle-aged man approached the musician, saying he had a "marketing opportunity" for Malvo and his songs. He didn't give his phone number, or his name.

Two days later, as instructed, Malvo met the man and his colleague at a cafe in Seoul. The men, whose names Malvo still doesn't know, looked "ordinary to the extreme," knit sweaters and all. "They told me they could get me 'into the charts,' " Malvo, whose real name is Lee Beomju, tells NPR. "I realized this wasn't a regular marketing offer. This was music sajaegi."

Some may be familiar with the term sajaegi through BTS, the boy group and K-pop wonder whose new album, Map of the Soul: 7, has just been released. BTS subtly brought some attention to online chart manipulation last December. "How about creating music using more honest means," said BTS member Jin at the Mnet Asian Music Awards, where the group won nine awards, including album of the year.

In Korea, sajaegi generally refers to the illegal bulk-buying of any item — for example, a firm in South Korea recently sajaegi-ed over four million face-masks due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak.

But in music, sajaegi has a more specific meaning — unethically and/or illegally boosting a chart ranking. For example, entertainment agencies bulk-buying their own CDs; or, probably more likely in the digital era, using bots or computer farms to repeatedly stream songs and hike up chart numbers. Sajaegi scandals are testing the Korean music industry, questioning the credibility of online charts, entertainment agencies and even some fan engagement.

Not easy to pin down

"Sajaegi has been around for a long time," argues Shin Daechul, a renowned musician who debuted with the legendary rock group Sinawe in 1986, and who now also works an artists' rights advocate at Bareun Music Cooperative. In the digital age, Shin tells NPR, "the media have changed, but the idea is the same. The methods have just gotten more covert."

On a neat powerpoint presentation, the men walked Malvo through a range of options, including the highest: getting to the top of the charts, which would cost him more than 300 million Korean won (over $250,000). Malvo isn't the only one with this experience — others have spoken out on being approached, including Tiger JK, one of Korea's biggest hip-hop acts.

"I once got an offer for 100 million won [around $84,000] to go higher in the charts," said Tiger JK in January on Unanswered Questions, a documentary series produced by broadcaster SBS. His 2015 song "I Know" alludes to the incident with the lyrics, "Do you really cost 100 million won?"

One of the most infamous sajaegi scandals in recent K-music history probably concerns Nilo. If you're a major K-pop fan and have never heard of him, you're probably not alone.

In 2018, one of Nilo's songs hit No.1 on Melon, the biggest music streaming platform in Korea. The feat sparked intense accusations of sajaegi against the virtually unknown-at-the-time singer, leaving his headlining song on Youtube filled with commenters mocking his allegedly fake No. 1.

He's not the only one suspected. Last November, Park Kyung, a member of boy band Block B, sarcastically said, in a now-deleted tweet, "I want to do sajaegi too, like Vibe, Song Ha-ye, Lim Jae-hyun, Jeon Sang-keun, Jang Deok-cheol and Hwang In-wook."

Those six artists subsequently sued Park Kyung for defamation. But Park's agency has vowed to defend the Block B singer, saying they want to get to the bottom of the rumors of chart manipulation, which is illegal under Korean law and punishable with 20 million won in fines (around $16,800) or up to two years in prison.

According to the national police's Cyber Investigation Department, police are currently investigating music sajaegi cases. But the department didn't have precise statistics about how many cases there were, or if anyone has ever been punished for the practice.

"Charts are supposed to be leading the music industry," tweeted Hong Seung-sung, founder of Cube Entertainment, a prominent K-pop agency. "But they've become sajaegi puppets."

Despite the size of the scandal, which has made headlines in the Korean music industry more than once in the last decade, it's actually not clear how sajaegi schemes operate in the music industry, nor even how commonly they occur.

Multiple sources from the SBS documentary suggested that entertainment agencies hire firms claiming to be "marketing companies," who then supposedly communicate with shady tech firms through brokers — none of whose identities are known.

"I don't think it's right to think of sajaegi firms working only with companies," argued the head of JYP, one of Korea's biggest labels, in 2015. "These firms can be hired by individuals within labels, or composers, or even the artist. There are many possibilities."

There's smoke everywhere, but no substantial proof that any of the sajaegi rumors are real. In 2013, JYP and three other major labels formally asked prosecutors to investigate sajaegi. Prosecutors dropped the request, saying there wasn't enough evidence. In 2018, Nilo and his agency, claiming innocence against accusations, asked the Ministry of Culture to investigate the matter. The ministry study proved inconclusive.

"When we spotted irregular streaming patterns, there was no way of knowing if the listener was a fan or some [sajaegi]account," an anonymous Ministry rep told Nocut News.

"Almost everyone, especially on the music production side, knows that sajaegi exists," Shin tells NPR. "It's so common that people just keep their mouths shut. Too many interests are tied in together."

Not everyone is convinced that sajaegi is all that common.

Can't try this at home

"It's not as simple as developing some automated program [that can stream music repeatedly]," said Chanam Park, CEO of Stealien, a hacker-run cyber security firm that has consulted for Melon in the past and whose staff have met with major entertainment companies to discuss the sajaegi problem.

Technically speaking, according to Park, a sajaegi scheme would likely involve either of two approaches: one, somehow go around a music site's various security measures and change the ranking directly. Second, own "an incredible amount" of IDs on a platform (like Spotify or Melon), and use them to stream music on different devices, e.g. at a computer farm.

The former is just as difficult to do as the latter, says Park. Hacking any major music platform is hard, considering the kind of precautions platforms take. Hypothetically, even if someone managed to, somehow, get large quantities of IDs, whether fake or stolen, the sajaegi scheme would need a near-perfect sense of timing.

"Let's say you're sajaegi-ing an album at the same time IU [a major K-pop star] releases one. Then owning just tens of thousands of IDs wouldn't even cut close," says Donghwi Shin, Stealien's senior vice president of research. "If you want to be No.1, there are so many conditions that need to be satisfied. It's really not that easy."

Mark Mulligan, a long-time music industry analyst at MIDiA Research, agrees. On technological manipulations, "streaming services normally have a series of measures that stop suspicious behavior quite early on," Mulligan says. "They have done a really good job of making those incidents a small part of the whole mix. The incidents happen, but they're not a meaningful part of the mix."

A genre with the "most" fans

Perhaps the larger question in the sajaegi scandal is defining what "online chart manipulation" even means in the digital era.

Mulligan says technological manipulations are "easier for tech firms to deal with. What [streaming services] can't deal with at the moment is fanbases doing it. And K-pop artists have got that asset unlike any other fanbase."

"The fan behavior of K-pop artists is beginning to transform the global landscape for fanbases," argues Mulligan.

K-pop fans are famous for their incredible mobilization, including planting a rainforest for their favorite artist and buying expensive ads in Times Square. There's even a Korean fan-slang word for streaming an artist repeatedly to boost chart numbers: sumseuming, or "streaming 24/7 as one breathes."

Can fan mobilization be manipulative, like sajaegi? Some superfans have allegedly gone too far, using multiple accounts and devices to mess with streaming data. In 2017, after a government request, Korean music services even changed their real-time ranking systems, to reduce chart manipulation by fans.

"We're just trying to support our idols," says Lamia Putri, a BTS fan from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Putri doesn't engage in endless streaming, because she has a full-time job.

To her, fan streaming is a form of engagement. Whereas sajaegi is"unfair. It's outside our control. It's created by people who have power. We're only fans. We can't do anything but get angry."

"If you listen all day on just one device, it's not manipulation. I think that's normal," she laughs. "I mean, I don't think that's normal, but I think it's okay. There's no policy that you should stop listening to music on a platform after a certain period of time."

Mulligan agrees. "If streaming services try to shut this stuff down, they're actually stopping valid fan engagement. There are no rules in streaming services in how much you're allowed to listen to one song. Nor should there be."

To observers like Mulligan, online charts are becoming an increasingly outdated tool to measure music.

"The success of an artist goes way beyond streaming itself," Mulligan says. "But record labels still compete with each other for market share based on chart position."

Despite the complexity of the music industry in the digital era, a narrow focus on online ranking is what drives the supposed sajaegi schemes in South Korea. "Unfortunately, charts are still seen as the only way to show an artist is top-class," says Shin. "We often say, 'out of sight, out of mind.' If you don't see the music on the charts, they seem to naturally go extinct."

Putri doesn't agree. "Sure, online charts are important. But there are so many musicians in the world. I don't think my idol has to be the first on the charts. As long as they have good music, it's okay."

The sajaegi problem is casting a shadow over the Korean music scene. But it's also triggering a much-needed debate. More prominent artists are speaking out, condemning the practice. Experts are discussing how to reassess the music charts in the digital era.

Meanwhile, Malvo is unfazed, determined to continue doing music the way he likes. "Those guys [who offered sajaegi] asked me, 'How long are you going to keep doing music that doesn't even enter the charts?' I think, isn't doing sajaegi more toxic? Isn't it like drinking the Holy Grail full of poison?"

Big Hit Entertainment, home to BTS, announced last week that it would hold its corporate briefing privately on Tuesday, despite having originally planned to open the event to the media and fans.



The agency said the event would go ahead without a live audience, and a video would be uploaded the following day.



According to YG Entertainment, Blackpink’s Lisa, who appears on Chinese idol audition program “Qing Chun You Ni” or “Idol Producer” as a mentor, didn't film the show on Saturday. Filming of the show has been put on hold until further notice.



Girl group LOONA also canceled a fan showcase event on Wednesday for the upcoming album “#” due to coronavirus concerns, but the group’s agency Blockberry Creative said the press event would go ahead as planned.



“The fan showcase event later in the afternoon was supposed to be attended by over 1,000 people, and given the infectious coronavirus, we decided to cancel the event,” the agency said in a statement.



The number of coronavirus patients in South Korea stood at 15 as of Monday morning, with over 17,000 cases confirmed around the world.



Health authorities here say the virus’ mortality rate is estimated at about 4 percent, based on information from China, where the virus originated. 



People have been from taking precautions, including schools postponing reopening, and the entertainment industry is no exception. 





Last week, photos of EXO member Baekhyun went viral online after he was seen at an airport wearing a mask and using a hand sanitizer.



Major weekly music shows like KBS’ “Music Bank” and SBS’ “Inkigayo” filmed their latest episodes without an audience due to health concerns.



In a statement on Thursday, KBS said its staff are wearing masks on the job and it has equipped its studios with a thermal camera and hand sanitizers in an effort to protect against the virus.



As concerns grow, some BTS fans are taking to Twitter to voice their worries, as the septet is set to embark on a new world tour in Seoul in April, visiting at least 18 cities all the way up to early September. 



“Big Hit Entertainment, please keep BTS safe. Make sure they wear masks and wash their hands, the coronavirus is currently in LA,” one fan wrote.



Another fan asked, “First case of coronavirus was in Santa Clara. Big Hit, please let us know if the BTS concert will be held there in April.”



Ticketing for the group’s US shows begin this week.







By Yim Hyun-su (hyunsu@heraldcorp.com)With BTS’ latest album ‘Map of the Soul: 7’ making waves around the world, it’s a good time for a streaming service to be shouting about the popularity of K-Pop on its platform. Spotify is that service: the company says that since the launch of its flagship ‘K-Pop Daebak’ playlist in 2014 then a wider K-Pop hub the following year, there have been more than 41bn K-Pop streams on Spotify. No surprises for guessing the top Korean group, either: having become the first Asian artist to reach the 5bn streams milestone on Spotify in April 2019, as of this month (February 2020) BTS now have more than 8bn streams – nearly 20% of the post-2014 K-Pop total.

Spotify cited Blackpink, Exo, Twice and Red Velvet as other K-Pop artists who’ve been popular with its listeners, adding that K-Pop’s share of listening on Spotify has grown by more than 1,800% between January 2014 and January 2020. 73% of Spotify’s K-Pop listeners are female, and 53% are aged between 18 and 24, while the biggest markets for this music on Spotify are the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and Brazil – remember, Spotify isn’t available in South Korea itself yet, although it’s rumoured to be launching there this year.

The stats were published as BTS launched an ‘enhanced album’ on Spotify for ‘Map of the Soul: 7’ – although at the time of writing, the enhancements appear to be just short intro and outro videos book-ending the album tracks. As of today, BTS have 17.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify, making them the 148th most popular artist on the platform.

Image by NINE STARS (CC BY 3.0)Last year also saw the birth of two high-profile rookie bands, Tomorrow X Together, a five-piece boy band also known as TXT and formed by Big Hit Entertainment, the music label of BTS, as well as ITZY, a five-member girl band by entertainment giant JYP Entertainment.Honestly, I only look up to you because I’m short 💀Parasite winning at the Oscars is one thing, the new much-hyped Filter track by BTS, is another. But nothing is quite like the overwhelming K-Pop hype at Fashion Week.

Some say that South Korean K-Pop stars are the world's biggest influencers, having the biggest pull on Instagram. Having the entire world going bananas for K-Pop, with bands selling out stadiums in just seconds, it makes sense that luxury fashion brands want their slice of the pie. With BTS wearing custom-made tour outfits designed by Kim Jones for Christian Dior, it’s likely their far-reaching appeal won’t stop anytime soon.

Are Korean celebrities becoming the next face of luxury fashion? G-Dragon was the first Korean musician to ever collaborate with Nike for limited edition sneakers, which sold out in a matter of seconds. The fashion ‘It Boy’ has been a Chanel ambassador, too, while Kai of the K-Pop group Exo is a muse for Gucci, too.

Case in point: Just yesterday, Lalisa Manoban, the star of the K-Pop group Blackpink, was in the front row of the Prada show today at Milan Fashion Week. The crowd went absolutely wild - far wilder than most fashion week scrums, stopping traffic more than any other celebrity.

The Thai porformer politely made her way to the venue, waving along the way, like the queen, only to slip into Prada’s front row, alongside talents like Tamu McPherson, Chiara Ferragni, Yoyo Cao and Caroline Daur. It’s what some are saying is the star’s foray into mega superstardom. New York's fashion photographer Petra Collins recently shot Manoban for VOGUE Korea, too.

It was just yesterday that another K-pop star stole the show at Gucci’s front row, too. The brand’s Alessandro Michele had your usual guests at his runway show (Dakota Johnson, Yara Shahidi, Florence Welch) but K-Pop star Lee Ji-eun, known as IU, dressed in a pretty pink gown from Gucci’s spring collection.

In a stunning pink dress, she is what VOGUE is calling Gucci’s latest muse.

Did it all start last summer, you ask? Mino, the South Korean rapper walked Paris Fashion Week for Louis Vuitton, was hand picked by Virgil Abloh, back in June. Gong Yoo, who is called the Brad Pitt of South Korea, was in attendance, as well.

That’s not to mention how Fendi has plucked Bigbang singer Taeyang for a capsule collection featuring jackets and hoodies. Meanwhile, Rosé from Blackpink is a new ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent designed by Anthony Vaccarello.

The K-Pop star Hwang Minhyun came to Milan Fashion Week for the Moncler Genius show on February 19, too. And just earlier this month, Park Soo-young, also known as “Joy,” from the supergroup Red Velvet, was caught departing the Michael Kors fashion show at the American Stock Exchange in New York on February 12, as part of New York Fashion Week. She also caused a craze at Miu Miu’s AW19 show at Paris Fashion Show, too.

Lucas wong from NCT was spotted at Burberry's SS20 show in London, as well. Irene (Bae Joo-hyun) from the band Red Velvet caused a craze at Miu Miu’s AW19 show at Paris Fashion Show, too. Her style has been described as refined yet youthful, for her playful takes on Chloé twill and Miu Miu wool, being both sleek and polished.

Of course, the global supergroup Blackpink attended fashion shows, like Chanel, Celine, Saint Laurent and Burberry. It provides the much-needed hype for the brands to stay in the spotlight.

And BTS members are always sporting new looks beyond your typical streetwear; they have worn Givenchy, Saint Laurent, Valentino, Chanel and Gucci.

As K-Pop continues on the rise, stars like Wong Yuk-hei, better known as Lucas Wong of WayV, NCT and SuperM, attended Burberry's SS20 London show in the brand's trademark garb. Jackson Wang is a rep for Fendi, too, after becoming a face for Cartier and Armani Beauty.

Expect much more to come. GQ Korea just released photos of boy band Exo's Kai Will, a Gucci ambassador, posing for their March 2020 issue. And as the South Korean pop culture critic Ha Jae-geun says: “K-pop stars did not evoke luxury images in the past, but as the Korean culture has been sweeping the world, their fashion has also garnered global attention.”In one photo for their album Map of the Soul: 7, the seven members of the South Korean supergroup BTS, or the Bangtan Boys, are cloaked in feathers, obscured by an ominous cloud of darkness. Other photos show them dressed in all white and in neutral tones, posing in the midst of a sumptuous feast in a shadowy room.

These images are a sharp detour from the colorful, Wes Anderson-esque aesthetic of their previous album, Map of the Soul: Persona, but that wasn’t a shock to fans: The Bangtan Boys’ public image, one that doesn’t rely on traditional forms of Western masculinity, is constantly evolving, as is their music. Fans will tell you that the Korean supergroup’s discography, once heavily inspired by hip-hop, belongs to no genre. What defines BTS — what sets them apart in the eyes of fans — is their emotional honesty, expressed through their lyrics, press interviews, and personal vlogs. Theirs is an underdog story, where they managed to surpass the odds to become one of the highest-earning K-pop acts and the unofficial face of Korean music worldwide.

In “Home,” a sentimental track that reflects on BTS’s material success, there’s a verse that translates to “the world thinks we own the whole world.” It sure seems like it. BTS’s new album, which was released February 21, had garnered more than 3.42 million preorders within the first week of its announcement. The boys have drawn comparisons to legendary music acts like the Beatles and the Jackson 5 for their ability to sell out massive arenas worldwide. They’ve sold out at least seven shows for the North American leg of their 2020 tour from fans in all 50 states, surpassing ticket sale records of top US pop stars Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.

The Western media — and the world, for that matter — has only been able to gawk at the sheer scale of BTS’s dominance. They’ve posed on the covers of glossy magazines with headlines like “How BTS Is Taking Over the World,” “Music’s Billion Dollar Boy Band Takes the Next Step,” and “The K-Pop Megastars Get Candid About Representing a New Generation.” BTS is receiving star treatment, but skepticism and resistance to their status as the world’s biggest pop stars still persist on the grounds of their “boy band” label, the (wrongful) assumption that their fan base is fueled solely by teenage devotion, and xenophobia from an industry traditionally dominated by white Western stars.

BTS’s path to superstardom was paved, in part, by South Korea’s wave of cultural exports to the West — from music to television dramas to elaborate skin care routines. Before BTS, a series of top K-pop acts (Big Bang, Girls’ Generation, EXO) have made US debuts, yet none really stuck, making the boys’ success even more unprecedented and unexpected.

In 2019, BTS reportedly brought in $4.65 billion for the South Korean economy through physical album sales, concert tickets, and branded merchandise. The band is currently worth 0.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and is projected to contribute $48 billion for South Korea by 2023, according to a report from the Hyundai Research Institute. These staggering numbers highlight how BTS’s influence is a 21st-century tour de force, something few Western pop artists are capable of achieving today.

At its heart, the music industry is driven by fan activity — the money poured into live shows, album sales, and official merchandise to bolster an emerging artist onto musical charts, whether that’s the US’s Billboard Hot 100 or South Korea’s Gaon Music Chart. To understand the scale of BTS’s success among other K-pop acts and Western artists, you have to delve into the Korean entertainment industry and understand how it’s a wholly different beast than its American counterpart, down to how its biggest stars are cultivated and marketed.

While record labels, artist management companies, and talent agencies operate as separate entities in America, Korean entertainment companies are a configuration of all three. “The top K-pop music companies are hybrid, highly integrated, full-stack ‘cultural technology’ enterprises,” said Bernie Cho, president of DFSB Kollective, a Seoul-based agency that specializes in distributing Korean music. That means they have a top-down approach when it comes to managing creative endeavors and, in some cases, producing and shaping an artist or a band.

This is best reflected through K-pop’s intense trainee system, where potential stars are recruited through auditions and cultivated over years of rigorous performance training. Music studios are typically responsible for a group’s formation, their marketing and music, and even their personal lives. While BTS members were recruited through this system, their management label, Big Hit Entertainment, took a different approach, placing fewer restrictions on them. BigHit CEO Bang Si-hyuk envisioned the boys as relatable, down-to-earth figures that fans could connect with. (BigHit did not respond to an emailed request for comment from Vox.)

Compared to other idols, BTS members have more creative and personal freedom, like the ability to write their own songs and lyrics and manage their own social media — aspects that BigHit aggressively marketed to audiences. The result is a massive international fan base nicknamed ARMY (an acronym for Adorable Representative MC for Youth), consisting of millions of people that span various ages and cultures.

These fans are well-organized and single-mindedly devoted to the Bangtan Boys. They constantly flood Twitter with hashtags to promote the band’s activities, organize to stream new music, and even create merch for other fans. Perhaps most importantly, fans see BTS as original, authentic, and socially conscious public figures who aren’t afraid to talk openly about the struggles and anxieties of their career path.

This core notion of authenticity — something that influencers, celebrities, and politicians alike aspire to embody — is a key factor in BTS’s astounding success overseas. It is a large part of the group’s appeal to companies seeking their endorsements. From 2013 to 2018, BTS sold more than $1.1 billion worth of branded items, and they’re expected to have an even greater economic impact than the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics within 10 years, according to the Hyundai Research Institute.

“When I talk to American BTS fans for my research, they say that they’re drawn to how genuine BTS is and how they’re saying something about themselves, rather than just talk about money, sex, and drugs [like American artists],” Ju Oak Kim, an assistant professor at Texas A&M International University who researches Korean pop culture and media, told me. “BTS blurs the line between [being a pop idol] and a person, and that’s a big difference for fans.”

The price of a music download or stream in Korea is worth shockingly little, Cho told me. “Selling the same exact song or exact same album, Korean acts could earn more than eight times more profit outside of Korea than inside,” he said. This has driven all types of Korean artists, from idols to indie singers, to go overseas and target an international audience. “There aren’t enough Koreans on this planet, living inside or outside of Korea, to singlehandedly make K-pop go global,” Cho said on BTS and the genre’s ascending popularity. “Simply put, international fans are why K-pop is international.”

“International fans are why K-pop is international”

While product sponsorships are common in the Korean entertainment industry, BTS has broken into the US market by the sheer force of its fandom, who have rallied stores like Hot Topic, Target, and Walmart to carry band merchandise and albums. That’s why you can find virtually every type of BTS-branded product imaginable on the internet. There’s BTS cold brew coffee, hand cream, Mattel dolls, and Funko Pop figurines. You can also buy BTS-inspired colored contacts, streetwear, Reebok shoes, and bank checks.

Granted, this is only a short list of BTS’s brand collaborations and official merchandise. There are thousands of other unofficial products on the market, and the Bangtan Boys are also ambassadors for Fila, the city of Seoul (for three consecutive years), the Hyundai Palisade, and an electric street racing championship hosted by Formula E.

In short, BTS is everywhere — in Korea and abroad. Their branding prowess is undeniable, and even products that are unintentionally promoted through a BTS member’s “golden touch” can quickly sell out, whether that’s a sweater, fabric softener, or a bottle of wine. As careful as a member might be to not name-drop a brand, it’s only a matter of time before sleuthing fans and BTS product accounts identify whatever they’re wearing or alluding to.

“The fandom is very focused on buying official merch from concerts, BigHit, or the BTS Line store because it directly supports BTS,” said Liv, a 24-year-old BTS fan from England who didn’t want to disclose her last name for privacy reasons. Liv has stopped purchasing BTS merch for herself, but she sometimes gives away items on Twitter for other fans to have a chance at owning some BTS goodies.

Money is an inextricable aspect of any music fandom culture, not just BTS’s: Fans want to support their favorite artists, and that devotion is usually expressed through purchasing concert tickets, albums, and merchandise collections — all things that help the artist succeed. Still, not everyone can afford that or live where merch is easily accessible, Liv told me, which is why she and her fellow ARMYs are so passionate about hosting social media giveaways. K-pop fan culture is especially consumerist because, as Caitlin Kelley wrote for MTV, fans understand “many Korean acts do not make much money if they haven’t attained the rarified stature of a top-selling group like BTS.”

Therefore, fans can feel like they have a responsibility to “support their faves” by buying branded items every time a new collaboration or album is released. The relationship is “like a parent giving unconditional love and support to their child, the band,” David Kim, a YouTuber who analyzes Korean culture and K-pop, told the Washington Post.

There’s a downside to this focus on consumerism: Some fans spend thousands of dollars on merchandise or travel to attend concerts and meet-and-greets. It’s normal to spend extra on multiple versions of collectibles. “Merch-shaming” also exists within some corners of K-pop fandom — the idea that having a more extensive merch collection or attending a lot of performances is the marker of a “good fan.” Fan culture is complicated, and not everyone buys into the consumerist (and classist) ideology that owning merch makes someone a more dedicated fan. Most fans buy merchandise and concert tickets simply because they love the artist.

Within online fan circles, ARMY members like Liv have found ways to make the BTS community more inclusive, especially for younger fans and those who live in places where it’s prohibitively expensive to get items shipped. US BTS ARMY, a not-for-profit organization and fan news site for BTS, occasionally hosts worldwide merch giveaways for global fans, and Album for Every ARMY is a charity project for fans who are unable to buy their own BTS albums.

“There’s a wide spectrum of ARMY fans, including those who are teenagers or are in school, that don’t have the extra income for merch,” Jackie, the chief financial officer at US BTS ARMY, told me. (Jackie, who volunteers to work on the site, asked to only be identified by her first name.)

“We like to partner with a company and host these giveaways so that anyone can have access to some of this official merchandise,” she said. As with most popular artists, there’s a vast black market for unofficial products created and sold by companies and independent artists alike. Big Hit Entertainment has previously sought to curb the use of the Bangtan Boys’ image and crack down on unauthorized merch outside of concerts, but online, small businesses by fans proliferate.

To their credit, fans are wary of off-brand merchandise that appears to be exploiting BTS’s image for purely monetary gain. However, ARMYs are generally supportive of small artists who create original trinkets and drawings, said Stephanie Le, a 21-year-old college student who runs the Happi Peach pin shop on Instagram.

Le has turned several of her original designs of BTS members into enamel pins, a hobby she’s managed to monetize in the past year. “Fans tend to purchase official merchandise, but they also see the value we bring to things that aren’t normally produced,” Le told me. “I consider myself a multi-fandom pin maker, but BTS has lately been a big inspiration for me so I’ve been drawing them more often.”

Her operation is relatively small (she needs at least 20 to 50 preorders before she can manufacture a pin design), but some apparel and merchandise makers operate full-time businesses that solely cater to K-pop fans and even carry official products. There’s a constant stream of demand for novel items or T-shirt designs, especially when a band like BTS releases a new album.

Demand for branded merchandise is huge, but most devoted fans know that physical album sales carry weight in official music rankings. ARMYs have been savvily setting goals online for the boys’ comeback in late February, according to Jackie. “When a new album comes out, we as a fan base try and encourage the purchase of the album in the country where you reside in so it counts towards a chart in that country,” she said. “Since we’re a US base, most of our goals are directed towards the US.”

That’s why Korean entertainment companies put so much effort into developing sleek, beautifully crafted albums; they’re marketed as collectibles, not just music products. (BTS was nominated for a 2019 Grammy in the Best Recording Package category.) “Instead of buying a CD with a booklet, you often buy a luxurious photo book [that comes] with posters, postcards, stickers, or tickets — with the CD thrown in as a bonus,” Cho of DFSB Collective told me of most K-pop albums.

The purchase of some of these extra items, like concert tickets or T-shirts, when paired with an album or single is considered “bundling,” something many top US artists do to boost album sales. (BTS’s upcoming album is not bundled with any merchandise, and the band is one of the few acts that have reached No. 1 on the charts without bundles.)

For ARMYs (and other K-pop fans), it doesn’t really make a difference what the album comes with or what it looks like; they’ve planned to purchase it from the start. This level of sincere devotion to an artist — and even mass mobilization on said artist’s behalf — is what helped propel BTS into the international limelight.

In other words, BTS fans take it upon themselves to actively promote the band’s work. They’ve already figured out the number of iTunes and Spotify streams, YouTube views, and Shazam song requests it would take for BTS to reach the No. 1 spot once Map of the Soul: 7 is released. If achieved, these goals would once again prove BTS’s ability to top the Billboard charts. This energy is something that even well-known stars like Justin Bieber struggle to capture: animating legions of fans to stream or buy music that will benefit the artist.

When journalists and music critics speculate about the future of BTS, the narrative inevitably turns to South Korea’s two-year military service requirement, which all BTS members will be subject to by the time they’re 28. For fans, it’s a fraught and bittersweet reality given that Jin, BTS’s oldest member, will turn 28 in December. With this latest record, however, 2020 will likely be another big year for the young men in both music and commercial spaces.

In a corporate briefing in early February, BigHit announced its plans to invest in a more immersive BTS concert experience, introducing “tour villages” in select cities with attractions like a BTS-themed hotel, an exclusive pop-up store, and other themed exhibits. The label is placing its focus on what fans want, a crucial part of its formula for success, according to executives. BTS’s trajectory in the past three years has been unstoppable; they’ve smashed records, sold out stadiums, cemented their international presence, and signed another seven-year contract, which means they’ll likely keep performing into their 30s.

“As long as our bodies hold up, we’ll be doing the same thing in 10 years,” Suga, one of the group’s three rappers, told the Hollywood Reporter in a cover story last year (a story that was thoroughly criticized by fans for its inaccuracies, culturally insensitive sentiments, and lack of prior research).

And, likely, as long as BTS’s bodies hold up, it’s not a question whether their fan base will continue supporting them, financially and artistically, individually or as a group. Whatever they do and wherever they go, the ARMY will be behind them.

Update February 20: This story has been updated to clarify the practice of merchandise bundling.

Once you dip your foot into it, you’ll just get sucked in to all that’s out there,” said Haewon Jun, a University of Minnesota grad student who performs with and sits on the board of Minnesota Kpop Dance Crew (MKDC), Minnesota’s lone entrant into the Asian worldwide phenomenon known as Kpop.

Kpop is known for its hyper-optimistic outlook, rigorous dance choreography and infectious beats. Its biggest stars — SET, Blackpink, BTS, EXO, Seventeen, Red Velvet, Twice, Momoland — are hardly household names. But to a growing group of Kpop lovers in Minnesota, the music, videos and dances provide big fun and connection to community.

“I was doing Kpop covers before I even founded this team in 2013,” said MKDC leader Volcano Kim, as she and Jun welcomed registrants to the Kpop dance workshop they organized, held Saturday in a dance studio at the U’s bustling rec center.

“When I was living in Korea, Korea has a huge community doing covers already. It’s very common, because it’s our own Kpop and we’re doing what we like. But then I moved to America and I was a little bit bored; there was nothing to do.

“I was in my undergrad year in Massachusetts, and I founded a group there called DBJ dance crew, a five-college crew that [draws from] University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Smith College, Amherst College, and Mount Holyoke College. I graduated and moved to Minnesota to do my master’s and Ph.D., and I needed a hobby.”

And how: Since its inception, MKDC has traveled the country and to South Korea, performing its tightly honed choreography and cover songs, and won competitions along the way. In 2018 and 2019, MKDC took first place in dance competitions in Los Angeles, New York City, and Seoul, South Korea, and put on a successful Kpop festival on the campus of the University of Minnesota.

They also regularly put on successful workshops. “I’m from White Bear, and we come to the workshops a lot for the dancing,” said Cassidy Lee, standing in the registrants line with her friends and fellow dancers Emily Vang, Adeline Leung, and Hallie Xiong. “The dances are fun, and the Kpop music is fun. My favorite Kpop group? I really like this group called NCT. They’re pretty popular in the U.S.”

“It’s not just for fun, it’s more like semi-professional now,” said Kim. “We get paid to travel the States now, so it’s not entirely a hobby anymore.”

Is MKDC the only Kpop game in town? A quick scan of the club scene here suggests that not even a regular Kpop night is scheduled anywhere anytime soon, although Saturday’s workshop suggests any such endeavor would be a wildly welcome addition to the dance club scene.

“I don’t see much in Minnesota, because it’s cold,” said Kim. “A lot of Kpop festivals and events are held outside. We’re about it. That’s why people are always sending us requests, like, ‘Can you host this event?’”

The main draw to Kpop is that it’s super-manufactured modern electropop — optimistic, exuberant, fun, sexy, escapist, smart, meaningful, funny, and impossible to not try to dance like your Kpop heroes — all of which transcends language and culture.

“In Korea, it’s like cosplaying,” said Kim. “You’re dressing up like that person, you’re doing the hair and gestures exactly like they are. You have to have stage presence, you have to lip-synch to the music, and you’re doing all the gestures that they’re doing. So you’re covering, but you’re also cosplaying the artist.

“The major thing that I’m seeing is that the older generation likes listening to the music more. Our generation, we need the visual stuff. We’re watching YouTube all the time; it’s not just listening to music. And I think Kpop has that aspect of like, it’s not just the music. It’s a visual overall performance of it, so you’re looking into the dances, you’re looking into outfits, and hairstyles.”

“There’s a Kpop group for everyone’s preference; there’s so many different songs and different types of visuals,” said Jun.

MinnPost took in the MKDC workshop, in photos and interviews:

Haewon Jun: “I’m from Busan, South Korea. I started my undergrad at the U in 2013 and I’m in my graduate program in integrated behavioral health. I joined MKDC year two, and I’m one of the board members. We started as a student group, just because we were interested in Kpop and we wanted to get people together and practice and put performances on.

“The very first performance that MKDC held I actually attended. I thought they were fascinating and so different from other Kpop cover groups that are out there, and they were promoting their auditions and that’s how I joined the group.

“There’s a cultural difference, but when we travel to different states, we see how Kpop is bringing in the whole community, and there is a huge community in the U.S. now, and it’s crazy how exponentially it has grown. In our third year, we held a Kpop festival in Minnesota for the people in the Midwest who are Kpop fans. Back then, Kpop groups wouldn’t really come to Minnesota because it wasn’t that popular a state for Kpop concerts, so we held our own festival at Northrop, and 1,500 people came out.

“We didn’t really expect a turnout like that, but that really made us realize that there are a lot of Kpop fans out there, and when we come together it’s a space where they can all be passionate about what they really like and what they spend their leisure time doing. It’s been really cool.”

Hieu Tram, Minneapolis, and Pasha Yang, St. Paul: “I first discovered Kpop with my aunts, who are into the old-school Kpop,” said Yang. “I got into it through them, just because the dancing was so cool. And the videos were more high-scale than a lot of the American music videos, so it’s just very interesting to see the difference between the two. I like Kpop because of the community surrounding it. Like, with our workshop today, we’ve brought in so many other Kpop fans who love Kpop. Some of them might not even dance, but because their love for Kpop is so big, then they decide to show up and show support for us and their love for Kpop. It’s a lot different from the American pop community; I think our community is special.”

“I went to a private school, St. Rose of Lima in Roseville, during middle school, and I was a minority, so I wanted to see what other cultures are out there,” said Tram. “Somehow I geared towards Kpop as an entryway, because I’m Vietnamese-American and I wanted to do something different from what the culture was at my school at the time. As a general personality issue, I don’t like to go with the general [mainstream]; I like to stray off and see what other things there are to look at.”

Zian Gao: “I’m originally from China. I’m a group member of MKDC. Kpop is a big culture in Asian countries already, and the idols, we look up to them as role models. Some of the younger generation, they even wanted to become like them, so they work hard and go to dance practice. They also put that focus into their daily lives, into their studies and work life. The choreography is hard and [disciplined], and it’s almost like a boot camp when they’re learning to dance like the idols. We’re trying to imitate their dances and cover their dances, and we put a crazy amount of time practicing so we can be perfectly in sync. People are connected by the Kpop groups they like, and by their fandom.”South Korea’s pop artists are making waves at fashion weeks across the world. In 2019, BTS attended Burberry, Chanel, Celine and Saint Laurent shows, while Dior’s artistic director Kim Jones designed the boy band’s outfits for their ‘Love Yourself: Speak Yourself’ world tour. Meanwhile, Exo’s Kai became the first Korean global ambassador for Gucci and Big Bang’s G-Dragon has struck up relationships with fashion’s mightiest (including Chanel). Former 2NE1 members CL and Sandara Park and girl group Blackpink are familiar faces across the Big Four fashion weeks, too.



As K-pop continues to flourish, we’re likely to see more of its highly influential and immaculately styled stars attending the fashion calendar’s biggest dates. Here, Vogue takes a look at the seven K-pop idols you might spot on the FROW during fashion month.

Wong Yuk-hei (better known by his stage name, Lucas) is a member of WayV as well as NCT and supergroup SuperM, making this 21-year-old pop star very busy indeed. He’s no stranger to the catwalk having walked for Korean brands KYE and Charm’s during SS19’s Hera Seoul Fashion Week, appeared at Burberry events in Beijing and Chengdu, and also attended the British brand’s SS20 show in London.

Lucas has proved he can pull off a bold print (such as Dries van Noten’s marble or Alexander McQueen’s AW18 flower suits), but in real life he keeps things clean and simple. Black, white and earthy tones are frequent go-tos, and Wong relies on brands such as Wooyoungmi, Balenciaga, Converse, Supreme, Off-White and, of course, Burberry. The perfect mix of streetwear and preppy boy-next-door, you’ll usually catch his million-dollar smile emerging from a bucket hat pulled down low.

The already popular Girl group Itzy (Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna) only debuted in February 2019, but they’ve scooped a dozen trophies at various Asian music awards and have played a US showcase tour. Louis Vuitton has taken them under its wing — all five members attended the Cruise 2020 show in New York and SS20 in Paris — and their loud, feisty pop certainly suits Nicolas Ghesquière’s audacious catwalk statements. Much of Itzy’s stagewear revolves around pleated tartan skirts, fitted crop tops, thigh-high boots, touches of sportswear and BDSM accessories, but they’ve also been known to rock some serious glitter and gold. Youthful and versatile, their downtime wardrobe shifts from voluminous hoodies to oversized blazers and leather jackets with straight-leg jeans for student chic that always looks effortless.

Irene (Bae Joo-hyun), the 28-year-old leader of girl group Red Velvet, stopped traffic when she arrived at Miu Miu’s AW19 show in Paris wearing a black and gold sequin dress from the label’s SS19 collection, a diamanté bow choker and a black blazer draped over her shoulders. Her style frequently mirrors Miu Miu’s old-world elegance with an edge, so it’s little surprise that the house appointed her a brand ambassador in the summer of 2019.

Although Irene’s stage costumes can sometimes veer towards risqué, her personal style is refined yet youthful. She switches between coquettish (ruffles, cold-shoulder tops, gingham and delicate prints, such as the Chloé twill minidress she wore to a Byredo event) and functional (Miu Miu wool blazers, Margiela deconstructed sweaters, fine knits and straight-leg jeans). Her choice of accessories — Cartier tank watches and shoulder bags by Gucci and Bottega Veneta — are sleek and understated. Irene’s polished look is, essentially, Paris Fashion Week in a nutshell.

Exo has a number of fashionistas in its boy band ranks — it’s been impossible to miss the sartorial rise of Kai, Gucci favourite and GQ’s 7th Best Dressed Man of 2020 — but Sehun, the group’s youngest at 25, has found his own niche. Beloved by fashion magazine editors for his narrow, chiselled jaw, he’s also been associated with Louis Vuitton for several years, attending Paris shows in 2017 and 2018, and last year’s Gangnam-gu opening of Louis Vuitton Maison Seoul. In contrast to Kai’s more flamboyant style, Sehun is consistently low key — bomber or varsity jackets, single-breasted suits, baseball caps, narrow-leg trousers and denim — in a palette of black, navy, white, tan and grey, with the occasional glimpse of a primary colour. This minimalist style may seem atypical for K-pop where more is more, but it strikes a perfect harmony with the coolly quiet Sehun, lending him a worldliness beyond his years.

This former sabre fencer is currently juggling being a soloist and GOT7's rapper. Jackson dropped the single Fendiman in 2018, after which Fendi announced his signing as an ambassador, stating that “unique, talented, daring to innovate and break through, Jackson Wang is perfectly connected to Fendi’s spirit”. He released a capsule collection with the brand, which sold out immediately, and performed at its AW19 show in Milan. More recently, Wang’s become a face for Cartier and Armani Beauty, putting those killer cheekbones to good use.

Jackson divulged to Vogue that he’s a firm fan of black, black and more black, lifting his luxe sportswear look with a pop of colour via a statement piece and copious accessories (sunglasses, chunky jewellery, beanies). Like fellow musician and personality Kris Wu, it’s hard to see Wang’s influential star fading within the country’s luxury fashion market any time soon.

Rapper Mino has an eclectic, experimental taste that moves through phases, from loud plaid suits to layered streetwear, to mixing new and old-school menswear designers such as JW Anderson and Ralph Lauren Polo. The 26-year-old has attended several Burberry events — front row at SS18, and the Seoul launch of the Thomas Burberry Monogram collection where he wore the SS19 “Why Did They Kill Bambi” shirt over a white string shirt — and walked for Louis Vuitton’s SS20 show.

Mino’s airport fashion makes headlines in South Korea, particularly his wearing of a black suit with nothing under it and last month when he wore a Dolce & Gabbana sunflower scarf like a babushka, along with a pale-pink fleece bomber and a crocheted sunflower bag. His style appears to be cerebral and instinctual, driven by what's presently inspiring his music or art (Mino’s paintings had their first gallery showing in December 2019) but rarely does he make anything less than a big statement. As one of K-pop’s most fashion-forward idols, he has the potential to make just as many sartorial waves as his label mate G-Dragon.

Former member of Wonder Girls and now one of K-pop’s biggest female soloists, Sunmi has a chameleonic charm when it comes to fashion. She drives up the glam onstage in dazzling minidresses from Discount Universe, Dior and Ashish, plays a catwalk e-girl in her music video for LALALAY, and goes for off-duty comfort in pale denim, boots and oversize coats. But one thing is certain: her love of handbags. Sunmi has renewed her partnership for 2020 with bag designer OrYany, and her Instagram is packed with covetable arm candy by Stand Studio, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada, whose SS20 show she attended in Milan. Her style frequently brings together opposing forces, such as heavy combat boots with floaty, pleated dresses, creating an aesthetic that’s distinctively girly with a full-grown, womanly twist.

When he featured a same-sex kiss in his debut video, 2018’s super-cute “Neverland”, Holland was aware of the risk he was taking. At best he would be ignored, at worst he could end his career before it had even started. Even his name is a statement – Go Tae-seob renamed himself Holland as a nod to the country that was the first to legalise same-sex marriage. As the only openly LGBTQ+ K-Pop star, Holland’s daring debut flew under the radar of much of Seoul’s media. Yet it sent K-Pop fans into a frenzy – Neverland was viewed 1.6 million times in just 24 hours.

Since then the 24-year-old has built a sizable and ever-increasing audience. Nearly 13 million people have so far viewed “Neverland”; 4.8 million have watched the self-possessed “I’m Not Afraid” and 1 million its counterpart, the conversely vulnerable “I’m So Afraid”. His recently released single, the relentlessly optimistic “Loved You Better”, is currently on 2.5 million views. Holland has nearly a million followers on Instagram and when he decided to crowdfund to raise funds for his self-titled debut release, he doubled his $50,000 (£38,800) target in 48 hours.

As well as a fearless trailblazer and LGBTQ+ advocate, Holland is a talented musician with great style. Vogue’s Hattie Collins met the K-Pop star during his recent European tour.

Why do you think K-Pop has been so successful? We take it for granted, but it’s still pretty incredible that a genre of music sung predominantly in Korean has not only become popular globally but is breaking records and creating worldwide superstars.



“Historically, Korea is a country that went through a period of extreme rapid economic development, so it’s very attuned to worldwide trends; we’re able to quickly pinpoint what people want, then adapt and refine, producing high-quality results. The same applies to the Korean music industry and K-Pop. We were able to identify trends, polish and produce high-quality performances and music. There is also open and regular communication between fans and artists.”



How do you reflect now on your debut Holland?



“I’ve developed a lot since then. Even until shortly after my debut, I still felt very much like a naïve and regular boy in his early 20’s. Now, I feel like I’ve matured and learned a lot through meeting new people. I also feel that because my musical perspective has broadened, I’m getting closer to becoming a true artist. As much love as I have received from my fans, I’m working that much harder to repay them through good music.”



Why was it so important for you to be openly LGBTQ+ from your very first release, despite no precedent for gay, bisexual or trans K-Pop stars?



“When I was younger, there wasn’t a Korean idol singer who had openly come out or revealed their LGBTQ+ status. So during my schooling years, when I was going through a tough time, I was influenced a lot by Western LGBTQ+ pop artists. I knew we needed a similar figure in Korea. I also wanted to share my story by making meaningful music for people to listen to. I got inspiration from the broader culture and mindset of the generation, and also from looking back on my own life, the experiences I went through.”



How do you think you’re working for inclusivity and acceptance?



“I believe the music I make, the messages I deliver to my fans and the meaning of my existence itself influences people. It’s still not common in Korean society to openly accept LGBTQ+ individuals or the community, so I hope there are more opportunities to talk openly about homosexuality in the future. I believe my music is playing a role in broadening this conversation.”

Are you supported by the K-Pop community in Korea?



“I do have supportive people around me, however, because I haven’t had the chance to meet or interact frequently with other K-Pop artists, I’m not quite sure how they view me. But there are still many artists out there who do respect and love my music and what I’m doing.”



Who in fashion interests you most at the moment?



“I’m inspired by Tyler, the Creator, Kanye West, Rihanna, Cardi B, and G-Dragon, who was recently discharged from his mandatory military service in South Korea. I’m also inspired by [Dazed] fashion director Robbie Spencer and Sébastien Meunier, the creative director for Ann Demeulemeester. My fashion style is very specific and distinct; in my daily life, I usually wear hoodies and prefer comfy streetwear, whereas when I need to be Holland-the-artist, I dress in a more “romantic” style. For example, I wore a lot of Ann Demeulemeester during my Europe tour in December. I especially loved the boyish and vintage look of Demeulemeester; it suited me perfectly. I also love classic and simple looks with a statement piece. And I like high boots!”



You have clearly made an impact on fans – from the millions on YouTube to the £80,000 you crowdfunded. What do you think people like about you?



“More than other K-Pop idols, I do feel that I have a bit more of a self-centred, independent and individualistic image. I feel that my fans appreciate those candid and genuine aspects. In addition, minorities and marginalised communities exist all over the world, and I believe I was able to be a figure of hope and comfort to them. My goal is to create music with a positive message. The more I create and focus on my music, the better my understanding of myself; I get a clearer picture of what kind of stories I like to tell, what kind of values I have, and what kind of person I would like to be remembered as. These are opportunities for me to reflect on myself in an objective manner. It has been an enjoyable process.”



The “Neverland” video has had 12 million views. Does that blow your mind?



“I was surprised to have received a lot more support than I initially expected. I can’t believe people watched me kiss someone 12 million times! Not everyone can say people have watched them kiss someone over 12 million times!”



What impact on other young people do you think your coming out has had?



“When fans reach out to me via DM, fan letters or I meet them in person, they often tell me that they were able to come out to their family and friends because of me. Every time I hear something like that, I feel surprised and happy of course, but I also do worry a lot for them. I don’t think I’ve quite yet adjusted to the fact that I’m a public figure with that much influence. I’m very relieved if people consider me to be a positive influence. For the larger community, even if people don’t identify as LGBTQ+, I hope we are able to start a dialogue about the LGBTQ+ community, and once again think about them through me or through my music.”



What do you say to your young LGBTQ+ fans who want to come out?



“Whatever the reaction of people around you may be, please always remember one thing – even though there may be negative reactions, never think of it as your fault or place blame on yourself; it is never your fault, you never did anything wrong. You are more than worthy of love. The person you must love is yourself, more than anyone else. Please love yourself no matter what.”



How do you navigate the challenges of working within the music industry?



“It is a tough industry and it is true that many artists struggle mentally and/or physically. Me as well, it would be a lie if I said I’ve never struggled. It hasn’t been that long since I debuted, so I’m also still trying to find the best way to navigate the industry in a way that works for me. But I’m also able to find some healing through my work. In Korea, mental health is still a stigmatised topic so I hope we can be more open about talking about mental care and treatment. In the future, I hope that we can collectively change our mindset.”



What are you most looking forward to about 2020?



“In 2020, no matter what, I want to try harder to be thankful for all the things that happen – whether they’re good things or bad things. And I will try harder to live with a more positive mindset. I also want to release my full-length album. My goal is to work extremely hard on it, to the best of my abilities, so that it meets even my own standards. I have a lot of ambitions, but I want to challenge myself in many fields: I want to try my hand at acting; give a TED talk; improve my English; and promote in many different countries. Long-term, I would like people to remember me, Holland, not just as a K-Pop idol, but as an icon who left a lasting legacy in many fields and industries.”



Not much then!

“Exactly (laughs).”



Who would you be interested in collaborating with in the future?



“A K-Pop artist I would like to collaborate with is Sunmi. Frank Ocean and Harry Styles are the pop artists I would love to collaborate with… please!”



Holland is working on new material due later this year.

As K-pop continues to flourish, we’re likely to see more of its highly influential and immaculately styled stars collaborating with houses and designers. Here, Miss Vogue takes a look at the seven K-pop idols shaping fashion, right now.



Lucas Wong

Wong Yuk-hei (better known by his stage name, Lucas) is a member of WayV, as well as NCT’s sub-unit NCT U and supergroup SuperM, making this 21-year-old pop star very busy indeed. He’s no stranger to the catwalk having walked for Korean brands KYE and Charm’s during spring/summer 2019’s Hera Seoul Fashion Week, appeared at Burberry events in Beijing and Chengdu, and attended the brand’s spring/summer 2020 show in London.

Lucas has proved he can pull off a bold print (such as Dries van Noten’s marble or Alexander McQueen’s autumn/winter 2018 flower suits), but in real life he keeps things clean and simple.

Sunmi

Former member of Wonder Girls and now one of K-pop’s biggest female soloists, Sunmi has a chameleonic charm when it comes to fashion. She drives up the glam onstage in dazzling minidresses from Discount Universe, Dior and Ashish, plays a catwalk e-girl in her music video for LALALAY, and goes for off-duty comfort in pale denim, boots and oversize coats. But one thing is certain: her love of handbags. Sunmi has renewed her partnership for 2020 with bag designer OrYany, and her Instagram is packed with covetable arm candy by Stand Studio, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada, whose spring/summer 2020 show she attended in Milan. Her style frequently brings together opposing forces, such as heavy combat boots with floaty, pleated dresses, creating an aesthetic that’s distinctively girly with a full-grown, womanly twist.

Looks like we are having a problem on the server.The rich diversity of Korean music isn’t limited to the country’s most popular musical export.As the phenomenon of K-Pop spreads outside South Korea, the most popular artists of the genre are not only influencing the global music scene but also setting trends in modern streetwear.



Music and fashion have always walked hand in hand, forming a dynamic relationship that works together to create exciting visuals, either in the production of music videos or the creation of fashion trends. This has been no different when it comes to the ever-growing K-Pop genre



But even before the recent explosion of K-Pop in western culture, artists of the genre, commonly known as "idols," have been influencing fashion for years. K-Pop idols have been pushing the boundaries of fashion ― working with an industry that goes beyond just music, these idols have always relied heavily on the visuals of their performances and music videos.



These idols prominently wear urban and youthful looks, always playing with the idea of high and low, focusing on creating a visual performance with clothing, with the characteristics of the street style approach.



Among the various trends set by these artists, the most prominent and consistent one is without a doubt streetwear.



Last year G-Dragon's Nike Air Force 1 "Para-Noise" splashed headlines after the sneakers ran out of stock immediately after its release on November 23, 2019. People all over the world wanted to get their hands on BIGBANG's leader's sneaker collaboration with Nike. Originally priced at $200, the much-coveted shoes resell price could be seen up to $4,000. "Para-Noise" was considered one of the most successful sneakers drops of 2019, such that another collaboration is already underway, rumored to be released this year. 



BTS, the first K-Pop group to top the Bilboard-200 chart, also made waves in the street style universe with its PUMA collaboration, releasing the "PUMA X BTS Basket Patent Sneakers" in 2018.



Going even further back to 2017, former EXO member Kris Wu released a collaboration with Burberry; and TaeYang, a member of BIGBANG, worked with Fendi to drop a capsule collection of bags, hoodies and T-shirts.



These K-pop artists' collaborations share a common ground; that is their inherently hip and modern take in streetwear. Since the fashion seen in the audiovisual content and performances of idols incorporate bold and loud colors and prints, naturally these elements translate to their casual style and, consequently, their fashion collaborations that try to emulate their visuals in products more accessible to the audience.



So, evidently, it did not take long for western companies to tap into K-pop idols and their massive fan base to promote their brands and products.



Recently, Beyonce released the campaign for her Ivy Park collection with adidas, which featured none other than CL, former member of 2NE1 and street style icon.



"Several people look at what the K-Pop stars are wearing to the airport and follow their style," said Sinxity, founder of Axis, a South Korean entertainment company. "The product they wear causes huge spikes for the brand in the following 24-48 hours. Idols' styles are carefully curated by half a dozen stylists and their cutting edge fashion catches the eyes of fans. Their influence in streetwear seems inevitable and necessary."



Nowadays, K-Pop idols' influence does not end with just fashion collaborations, their presence has grown so much that they can be easily seen in the front row at many fashion shows. The idols have undeniably established themselves as modern influencers in not only streetwear but in fashion.There is a new TV show trend among local networks ― foreigners learning and experiencing Korean culture. 

 Programs featuring foreigners have frequently been superficial, such as those about foreigners living here ("My Neighbor, Charles") or visiting Korea for the first time ("Welcome, First Time in Korea?"). 

 However, as K-pop and Korean content have infiltrated deeper into the global market, the new pattern of shows has emerged, putting emphasis on how susceptible ex-pats are to the culture and language. 

 In the first two months of this year, four new reality shows like this have gone to air.

 TvN's "K-pop Cultural Center," which started Feb.10, intends to teach Korean through songs to 10 foreigners, including YouTubers and actors. Each episode features different singers as the instructor, who uses their lyrics to teach the language and the cultural meaning behind them. 

 The show's producer said: "The song contains the language and philosophy of the time and projects all forms of culture, from joy, sorrow and love to family and social trends. So one of the best ways to understand a country is to learn its songs."

 With the same concept, SBS Plus' "Korean to the Ground," premiered Tuesday, invites beauty pageant contestants from four countries to learn Korean through various missions around Seoul. 



The foreigner version of popular KBS variety show "2 Days & 1 Night" also began airing last month. Led by the show's season 3 producer Kim Sung, the "Friendly Variety Show" invites a group of ex-pat TV personalities and Korean celebrities to tour the nation. The two groups compete for a better tour spot and to show diverse aspects of the country. 

 On top of variety shows, the JTBC talk show "Love of 7.7 Billion" puts the spotlight on the cultural differences regarding romantic relationships and dating issues. 

 The show features 14 foreign panels ― including from the U.S., China, Russia, Sweden, Colombia, South Africa and Morocco ― discussing their cultural backgrounds on various subjects. Each episode brings up different issues, such as wedding ceremonies and cohabitation, and is joined by a Korean celebrity guest to offer the Korean perspective.SEOUL (Reuters) - Big Hit Entertainment, the music label of South Korean boy band BTS, has chosen JPMorgan JPM.N, NH Investment and Securities 005940.KS and others to handle its initial public offering (IPO), according to media reports.

The IPO could be one of the largest in years in the country’s entertainment industry, with its total valuation expected to be as high as 6 trillion won ($5 billion), the reports said, citing industry sources.

Big Hit Entertainment has chosen three local brokerage firms - NH Investment & Securities, Korea Investment & Securities and Mirae Asset Daewoo 006800.KS for the IPO, sources with direct knowledge off the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity as the plan is not public yet.

The brokerage firms declined to comment, while JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Founded in 2005, the South Korean talent agency behind global sensation BTS has helped the South Korean superstar boy band score megahits globally and sell out U.S. stadiums. BTS also performed at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles last month.

BTS broke into the U.S. market in 2017 and was the first Korean group to win a Billboard music award. The band is set to launch a new world tour in April.

With BTS at the height of its popularity, it would be the right time to go public for Big Hit Entertainment, analysts said. But some are skeptical about the lofty valuation.

“The band members who are in their 20s must enlist for compulsory military service in a few years,” said Yoo Sung-man, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.

Big Hit Entertainment’s “valuable assets in their prime will be out of business for a while in the foreseeable future”.

Founder Bang Si-hyuk held the biggest stake of about 43.06% in Big Hit Entertainment as of the end of 2018, followed by gaming company Netmarble Corp's 251270.KS 25.22%, according to a regulatory filing by the music label.

Its operating profit nearly doubled to 64.1 billion won in 2018 from a year ago, according to the filing.Crate Digging is a recurring feature in which we take a deep dive into a genre and turn up several albums all music fans should know about.

Let’s start this off by clearing up a big misconception that must be addressed: K-pop is not a genre. A type of music? Sure. An industry? Yes. A musical scene? Definitely. But not a specific genre. Boom, now we can move forward.



In all seriousness, though, K-pop is more of an umbrella term that encompasses many genres like hip-hop, synthpop, rap, EDM, and pretty much everything else –often mixed together into one single song. For categorization purposes, it’s easier to just box Korean idols and pretty much any Korean artist that has a fan base outside of Korea into “K-pop” and call it a day. But when even in the idol world you have groups as starkly different as the bubbly, happy-go-lucky TWICE and the grungy pop-EDM of NCT 127, and then you add popular R&B soloists like Heize or Crush, while also bringing in rappers like Zico into the mix, “K-pop” as a specific genre moniker just doesn’t make sense.

CedarBough Saeji, a professor in Korean Studies at Indiana University Bloomington known as “The K-pop Professor” on social media, points out that one of K-pop’s most distinctive characteristics is that it is genre fluid. In a recent-ish podcast, Saeji explained K-pop with a recipe analogy. “If you’re gonna make banana bread, then you definitely need bananas in there. And you need to have some flour, and some things like that. So what else is there? You need enough of the ingredients that people recognize as being primary ingredients of K-pop. If you have enough of these key elements that make up K-pop, then [that’s K-pop],” she said.

When it comes to production, K-pop is always shifting; songs that are popular now sound very different to those released just two years ago when the trop-house craze was booming, or even that weird dub-step stint eight years ago. K-pop thrives by either beating the trendy sounds of the day to a pulp or living a few years ahead in the pop future — that’s why K-pop songs either age terribly nostalgic or transcend the boundaries of aging.

Also, as an industry, K-pop focuses more on singles than complete bodies of work — though this is slowly changing — and B-sides often serve as fodder to sell the glitzy main song. However, if you consider yourself a multi-fan (meaning a fan of multiple groups in K-pop lingo), you might be more open to explore the albums of many other groups outside of your faves and expand your K-pop experience.

As aforementioned, time isn’t exactly the kindest to K-pop, and while classic songs instantly come to mind, albums are a tougher task. That’s why instead of focusing on quintessential albums, we’re opting for a range of artists and albums that showcase just how genre diverse K-pop really is.Spotify has just released a truckload of K-Pop-related stats.

There have been more than 41 billion K-Pop streams on the platform to date and Spotify users around the world have added K-Pop songs to more than 96m playlists.

K-Pop’s share of listening on the platform increased by more than 1,800% between January 2014 and January 2020.

Since 2014, K-Pop music has been streamed for more than 134bn minutes on Spotify, according to the company.

The Top 10 countries for streaming K-Pop at the moment (in the past 90 days) are the US, Indonesia, Philippines, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada and Singapore. The UK falls just outside the Top 10, at No.11.

K-Pop music streams in all 79 of the markets Spotify is active in, with Egypt, Vietnam, France and Colombia seeing 33%, 30%, 13% and 8% growth increases in the rate of K-Pop streaming from January 2019 to Jan 2020, respectively.

The top-streamed K-Pop artists on Spotify are: BTS (pictured), BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE and Red Velvet.

BTS’s music has been streamed more than 8bn times on Spotify.

The top-streamed K-Pop track on Spotify is Boy With Luv from BTS and US singer-songwriter Halsey.

The track has been streamed more than 380 million times.

Meanwhile, 53% of K-Pop listeners on Spotify are aged 18-24 and 73% of K-Pop listeners are female, according to the streaming company.

Spotify rolled out a global rebrand for its New Music Friday playlist last week with cover stars, BTS.

“K-Pop Daebak”, Spotify’s first K-Pop playlist (launched in 2014) now has more than 2.4 million followers.

“There’s no denying the massive global explosion of K-Pop over the last few years, and we’ve witnessed it first hand on Spotify,” says Kossy Ng, Head of Artist and Label Marketing in Asia.

“This is truly the first Asian music genre to resonate so well with a global audience. K-Pop fans are among the most passionate and active, and K-Pop fandom – the way fans function, communicate and connect with one another – is like no other.

“There’s no doubt that K-Pop’s immense popularity will only continue to grow, and we’re excited to continue driving discovery and connecting K-Pop artists to fans all over the world.”Music Business WorldwideThis is not a new trend. The world has been gobbling up Korean pop culture for years — and not just music or movies. As early as 2009, a Korean television drama called “Jumong” was so popular in Iran that families supposedly organized their dining and entertaining schedules around it. Korean products have been booming as well. Korean packaged noodles earned $413 million in trade in 2018. During the same year, K-beauty exports totaled more than $6 billion.

What explains this international cultural moment? More than 20 years ago, the Korean Wave, as it came to be known, began as a South Korean government project, much like the 20-year plans put in place by the former Eastern bloc. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, which brought the Korean economy to its knees, made the government realize it had become overly dependent on heavy industries with complicated supply chains.

Then, in May 1994, Korea’s Presidential Advisory Board on Science and Technology published a report suggesting that the film “Jurassic Park” could make as much in a single year as the combined sales of 1.5 million Hyundai automobiles. And so, the Korean government launched one of the world’s biggest soft-power offensives to rebrand and export Korean cultural products.

It curated and financed an ecosystem of entertainment, video games, cosmetics, fashion, food and practically every other image-enhancing product. The agricultural department began to fly in chefs from all over the world for an all-expense paid cooking tour of Korea. The Korean Ministry of Culture created sub-departments devoted entirely to the cause of exporting Korean pop culture. Governmental agencies such as the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency) even financed the translation of Korean dramas into other languages.

The plan worked — almost too well. Now, the South Korean government faces both the dream and nightmare: Its creation is so successful that it no longer needs the government to thrive.

In the early days of this project, most of these industries relied on the government for financial and regulatory support and oversight. For example, Korean authorities instituted a Korean film quota in 1967, requiring all domestic movie theaters to play Korean films for 146 days of the year. Furthermore, the national budget allocated a percentage of ticket receipts to reinvest in Korean film production. More notoriously, the government also censored Korean movies, establishing what messages would be shared via cinema.

But after the government gave filmmakers more license during the presidency of Kim Young-sam in the 1990s, Korean cinema took on a life of its own. Not only did it not need the protection of the government, but government intervention was actually interfering with its success. In 2013, former president Park Geun-hye created a McCarthy-esque secret blacklist of more than 9,000 Korean artists who were thought to be uncooperative with the government and seditious — including “Parasite” director Bong. The list was leaked in 2016, drawing a backlash as artists and citizens alike called for free expression. “Parasite,” a film that is openly critical of Korean society and its wealth disparities, would not have been possible without the subsequent shift to a freer environment.

A similar story can be found with K-pop. The Korean government initially assisted the pop-music industry by building massive performance spaces and occasionally subsidizing overseas concerts. The private sector was quick to take advantage, and entertainment conglomerates created the winning K-pop formula we know today, recruiting and training stars while young, buying tunes by the hundreds — including from Sweden — and hiring the United States’ best dance choreographers.

Yet this manner of K-pop factory is becoming a thing of the past. The members of BTS, for instance, write their own songs, some of which address social issues in Korea and around the world. And neither government intervention nor corporate machinery can fully explain how BTS last year became the first musical act since the Beatles to have three albums at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart within a 12-month period.

The success of Korea’s cultural exports far surpass what the Korean government could ever have imagined. It made Korea a pop-culture juggernaut — and, in doing so, lost its ability to control the narratives conveyed by this art. As history has proved again and again, the lesson from Korea’s soft-power experiment is that artists and creative expression almost always win in the end.Fear of the spread of coronavirus has taken a heavy toll on the South Korean entertainment industry, where many scheduled concerts and events have been canceled. The K-pop sector has been especially hurt.

Leading music talent management agency, JYP Entertainment postponed boy band GOT7’s concert at Thailand’s Rajamangala Stadium that had been scheduled for Feb. 14 and 15. Tickets for both shows were sold out and made the band the first K-pop act to fill the 50,000-seat venue for two days. The company then announced on Monday that the shows will now take place in early May.

Another major K-pop company YG Entertainment also cancelled concerts of WINNER and Sechs Kies, which were scheduled for mid-February and early March, respectively.

“Amidst the worldwide effort to prevent coronavirus from further spreading, YG is also closely monitoring the issue, with our artists and fans’ safety as the primary concern,” said the company in a statement.

Fast-rising girl band (G) I-DLE’s agency Cube Entertainment announced Thursday that the Bangkok stop of its world tour had been pushed from April to an undecided later date.

Major TV broadcasters KBS, MBC and SBS, which usually invite K-pop fans as live audiences when filming their weekly K-pop programs “Music Bank,” “Show! Music Core,” and “Popular Songs,” have closed their doors since January and simply recorded the performances.

The film industry is also hurting. Box office in January was the lowest for years, and February has seen like for like declines in ticket sales of 30-40%, as people fear going out in public places and sitting close to each other in cinemas.

Currently South Korea has recorded 28 cases of coronavirus and no fatalities. Seven of them have recovered and been released from quarantine.
• K-pop, now one of the most popular genres in the world, has many beloved stars.
• The industry and fans alike expect performers to keep a well-polished, professional image — and most do.
• But scandals emerge regularly — including sexual violence, blackmail, alleged drug trafficking, and more.
• K-pop's biggest stars are never far from the spotlight, or the industry's dark side.

While much of the music industry has been in a decline, K-pop continues to thrive. The phenomenon draws around $5 billion annually, and it's considered the seventh-most-popular music genre in the world. This year, according to estimates, the audience for "Hallyu," or Korean pop culture, will reach 100 million – or roughly double the population of South Korea.

In North America, the industry has exploded in popularity and profitability, and American pop darlings and their labels have taken note: In 2019, Lizzo and Lil Nas X teamed up with K-pop superstars for remixes to their songs "Truth Hurts" and "Old Town Road," respectively. BTS, arguably the most famous of South Korea's boy bands, has collaborated with Halsey and the Chainsmokers.

Ever in the spotlight, K-pop stars have been subjected to increasing pressure and scrutiny as the industry angles to become dominant on the global stage. The industry and fans alike expect them to have a polished public image.

Though the vast majority of K-pop artists maintain sterling reputations, the pressure of performance and image-maintenance can be too much to bear. The genre has been witness to a number of deaths by suicide in recent years, and scandals regularly emerge.

If K-pop artists are illuminated by the limelight, they are also never far from the industry's dark underbelly. From corruption and sexual violence to alleged drug trafficking, here are the most shocking K-pop incidents of the last several years.The universally appealing K-pop music has reached millions of youngsters across borders. The South Korean pop genre’s growing popularity, in a way, is rooted in how it blends various international music forms with the traditional Korean style. No wonder its fans are rising day by day in India too, so much that two Indian musicians are now also a part of a K-pop band.

We are talking about the band Z-Stars, who recently concluded their music tour in India. The band consists of seven Z-Boys and Z-Girls respectively, selected through auditions from across various Asian countries — Indonesia, Japan, India, Philippines, Vietnam and others — with the aim to create a global band incorporating multiple languages and music styles.

The band debuted last year in February, and is becoming increasingly popular among K-pop lovers.

The band spoke to indianexpress.com about their journey as a music group and the response they got from their fans in India. Excerpts:

How was your visit to India? Did you get a chance to visit tourist places, enjoy Indian delicacies?

India was great! The support and love we received was overwhelming. We could not visit any tourist spots during our visit here but we ate a lot of Indian food! We tried different kinds of curries, including butter chicken with naan. We even tried dosa and some really interesting tikkas that Sid (Siddhant Arora, band member from India) introduced us to.

What kind of response did you get from the audience in India?

It was phenomenal! We were not sure of the response we would receive in India but with every performance, be it at Vh1 Supersonic or at Hard Rock Cafe, we met fans that sang along with us and knew all about our music. A huge shoutout to our GalaxZ (name of Z-Stars fans) in India for all their love and support!

Your band has members from several countries. How is that influencing the kind of music you are making?

Well for starters, we’ve started to learn a little bit of each other’s languages. Including some songs! In fact, on stage at Vh1 Supersonic, we joined Priyanka (Priyanka Mazumdar, band member from India) in singing “Tum hi ho” which she taught us. Our last song, It’s Christmas!, showcased seven different languages. We aim to create more multilingual songs as we continue to grow together.

You all auditioned for the band. Tell us how your journey has been like.

All of our journeys began with auditions. We were then brought to South Korea to train as part of the Korean K-pop training system. The journey has been intense, requiring us to put in a lot of effort but it has definitely been worth it. We’ve grown so much since we first got to Korea and hope to keep getting better.

For all the latest Lifestyle News, download Indian Express App.With Parasite winning Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards and BTS breaking music records around the world, the wave of Korean pop culture known as the Hallyu has become a global sea swell.

As well as influencing international pop culture, Korean content is also shaping academia, with the Hallyu becoming the topic of a growing number of academic papers and dissertations. Sage Journal lists at least 100 research papers on aspects of the Hallyu, while academia.edu has over 1,600 and JSTOR has 276. Such works discuss the Hallyu from socio-cultural as well as economic perspectives, touching on topics that range from foreign policy to the finer aspects of fandom.

The proliferation of Hallyu-inspired academia is no surprise to Dal Yong Jin, a professor at the School of Communication, Simon Fraser University, British Columbia. The author of numerous research papers and books, he began writing about the Korean wave when the waves it made were primarily in Asia.

“I started to publish a piece of work on the Hallyu in 2003, and my paper was kind of the first paper on Hallyu written in English,” said Jin. “From the beginning of the Korean Wave phenomenon, I have thought that it would be one of the most important non-Western cultures and have continued to develop my understanding and analysis.”

Rather than focus on any particular cultural form, such as k-pop or films, he chose a more systematic approach focusing on aspects such as the digital Hallyu—digital games, smartphone technologies and webtoons—in books such as Communication, Digital Media and Popular Culture in Korea. He wrote about the Hallyu’s media significance in research papers such as The Social Mediascape of Transnational Korean Pop Culture: Hallyu 2.0 as Spreadable Media Practice.

“Over the past two decades, American cultural content has continued to dominate the global cultural markets; while a handful of local cultures, from Mexico and Brazil (telenovelas), Japan (animation and J-pop) and India (Bollywood movies) have challenged American power,” said Jin. “However, the Korean Wave has been unique as it is the only local cultural industry to penetrate both regional and global spheres with a variety of cultural content, not only film and dramas, but also popular music and digital games, which is unprecedented. This certainly teaches people to rethink their perception of cultural flows, and therefore, the role of local culture.”

Irina Lyan, a Lady Davis Fellow in the department of Asian Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has encountered fellow academics who have not taken the subject of the Hallyu seriously. As a sociologist, she wrote her dissertation on Cross-cultural Encounters in Israeli-Korean Technological Collaborations, but since 2012 she has also written multiple papers about the international fandom of Korean popular culture.

“I wrote my dissertation on a ‘serious and respected’ subject of international and cross-cultural management focusing on Israeli-Korean R&D collaborations,” said Lyan. “Yet I couldn't stay indifferent to Hallyu success, which started in Israel in the late 2000s. During my PhD I wrote five co-authored papers on Hallyu, so I always call them my unofficial dissertations.”

At the time some academics considered the pop culture topic to be superficial, focused on possibly transient aspects of culture.

“Actually, today I'm glad I did both of them,” said Lyan. “I also got positive feedback as it is a fascinating theme through which we can learn about globalization (or regionalization), soft power, fan communities, country-of-origin image, creative industries and much more,” said Lyan.

She has written about the Hallyu in co-authored papers such as Fan Entrepreneurship: Fandom, Agency and the Marketing of the Hallyu in Israel as well as From Holy Land to Hallyu Land: The Symbolic Journey Following The Korean Wave in Israel.

Academics don’t need to be a Hallyu fan to write about it, but writing a paper could inspire eventual fandom.

“I came to know about the Hallyu in 2010 when I was approached by the dean of the faculty of languages and translation (where I worked as a lecturer from 2009-2013), who asked me if I was willing to write a paper on Korean culture in the Middle East,” said Mohamed Elaskary, who teaches Arabic at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, a research university in Seoul. “I agreed and the outcome was a presentation on the reception of Korean culture in the Middle East, which I presented in a conference in Seoul in 2010. But my love for Hallyu actually started later, after 2013 when I watched Winter Sonata.”

During his research for The Korean Wave in the Middle East: Past and Present, he encountered fellow researchers who at the time considered the influence of the Hallyu to be exaggerated. That can no longer be said. Today, no one can deny an expanding international interest in the Hallyu.

“All over the Middle East, where I originally came from, many people, especially younger generations, know about k-culture whether in the form of k-pop, k-drama, k-beauty or even Korean medicinal services,“ said Elaskary. “I noted that the number of Arab patients who come to seek treatment at Korean hospitals increased so much that some of my students now work as interpreters for hospitals.”

According to Lyan, there are other reasons, the Hallyu may not previously have been considered a serious academic topic.

“It's mainly a female fandom and male fandoms like video gaming or sports suffer less from stigmatization,” said Lyan. ‘It's popular culture which includes TV dramas/series and pop-music, again sports fandoms enjoy more acceptance. I know that Western TV series enjoy mainstream success today, but in the case of Korean TV series many think about ‘soap operas’ and housewives.”

Kirstin Koeltzsch would not describe herself as a Hallyu fan. While she knew about k-pop and watched some k-dramas, her research was born out of a general interest in Asia, Japanese culture, and her own past.

“My interest for Korea derives from my personal past and the political situation,” said Koeltzch, who lives in Argentina. “I was born in Eastern Germany during the Cold War. Part of my family is from Eastern Europe and we experienced a similar situation during the division of Germany, as it is in Korea.”

As an anthropologist with a masters degree in social science, she is about to finish her doctoral thesis at the Centro de Investigación Social - CISOR (CONICET)on one specific influence of the Hallyu.

“I started doing research on the Hallyu because my research interest lies in bodily expressions and dance in popular cultures,” said Koeltzsch. “I have always been in contact with popular cultures and people from the working-class sector, so I found out that k-pop, Hallyu and Korean culture is very popular among adolescents and the young population in my environment. Dance plays an important role for them.”

As the author of Korean Popular Culture in Argentina, Koeltzsch wanted to research popular dance practice.

“As I live in Argentina, my research is about our society within Latin America, as it is important to know about social practice here in relation to the global world,” said Koeltzsch. “I wondered why Latin American teenagers focus on an Asian culture which would not be the most obvious reaction, but there are reasons for that, which I try to show with my research.”

Her fieldwork has taken her to Brazil and she hopes to go to different parts of Latin America where there is a significant Hallyu practice.

“When I presented my first research on k-pop, most other researchers had no idea at all that it existed,” said Koeltzsch. “In 2018 I invited some of the young dancers I work with to an academic event to do a performance during a congress, which was the first time many academics had seen that.”

In his classes at Simon Fraser University, Jin has five graduate students who study the Hallyu, with term paper subjects that range from cultural policy to k-pop.

“They are very active, both academically and practically,” said Jin. “They always participate in k-pop concerts and present their papers on k-pop, while publishing their papers in scholarly journals and books.”

He sees the success of Parasite as a milestone in the Hallyu and compares the film’s Oscar wins to BTS' success in the global music markets.

“Seemingly different, they share common characteristics. Both focus on personal and local specificities,” said Jin. “Instead of mixing local and global cultures, they primarily focus on local scenes. For example, when the seven members of BTS always attempt to make lyrics, in general their music is based on their personal experience, which resonates to global youth as well in that they feel and share similar hardships. Likewise, director Bong Joon-ho always writes and records so that he develops his movies from his personal experience rooted in local scenes. Having said that, the Korean Wave from now on will reshape its own strategies, which emphasize local actors, local cultures, and local mentalities in tandem with global trends. Parasite will certainly transform the Korean cultural industries, and therefore, the Korean Wave in the near future.”

However the Korean wave changes in the future, it is likely to influence academia too.Just recently I went to Shanghai, where I planned to stay for 10 days to celebrate Chinese New Year. I was excited to devour bowls of hand cut noodles amidst one of the world’s most famous skylines.

The coronavirus had other plans.

After every major cultural attraction shut down, my Shanghai itinerary was quickly derailed.

So, I took a 90 minute flight to Seoul where I had zero plans other than to avoid contracting a potentially life threatening virus.

Why Seoul? The combination of BBQ grill, karaoke and 24 hour saunas posed an ideal alternative itinerary. I’d also noticed that Korea was asserting major influence in almost every cultural category. In the past few weeks, we’ve seen K-Pop band BTS perform at the Grammy’s, making history as the first Korean performance at an American awards show while Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s film Parasite dominated The Oscars.

The Chinese have a phrase hallyu or The Korean Wave, to describe how South Korean pop culture has gained momentum since the 1990s. I knew cosmetics (K-Beauty), entertainment (K-drama), music (K-Pop) and fashion were all working to re-position Seoul as the new epicenter of global culture.

What I didn’t expect to find in Seoul was retail innovation.

Australia’s 2020 retail scene has been described by commentators as a ‘retail apocalypse.’ Many media outlets have gone so far as to call it a ‘bloodbath,’ citing 161 store closures in January alone. Like Australia, online retail in South Korea is experiencing double digit growth (+15% year on year), far outpacing offline sales. Yet if we compare % share of online retail, South Korea is significantly more advanced. Despite major growth in the past few years, online sales in Australia still account for only 9% of overall retail sales. In South Korea, this figure sits at ~25%, putting them third in the world.

With almost a quarter of every retail purchase made online, and many fashion brands operating exclusively online, South Korea offers a vision of Australia’s retail future. Yet it’s the furthest thing from an apocalypse.

Rather than eradicate physical stores completely, many South Korean brands create experiences that go far beyond shopping. After visiting multiple stores in Seoul, here are my three big takeouts:

1) Add to cart…in your own time

Rather than an extension of an online catalogue, many stores de-prioritized the act of making a purchase. Korean fashion store Ader Error actually hid its clothing. Dr Jart+ (one of Korea’s most loved cosmetic brands) had "discovery rooms" designed for stimulating the senses, without a shelf in sight. Just recently, AmorePacific, a South Korean cosmetics giant opened a store that had absolutely zero stock; instead opting to use the space for testing, tutorials and flower box workshops.

These brands envision a world where the majority if not all products are purchased online, which means their stores exist to offer a much more valuable exchange; a highly physical and often playful brand experience.

In Australia, we are often subject to suffocating customer service (“Just browsing?”) fueled by daily sales targets. In Seoul, none of the staff were approaching customers. These stores traded on-the-spot sales for stickier, memorable brand experiences. The sales assistants smiled as I left the stores after 45 minutes of purchase-free lingering. Even if I exited with empty hands, a valuable exchange had taken place.

With purchases increasingly made on two dimensional mobile screens, Korean stores were designed to remind us how good seeing "in 4D" could be. Knowing that we so often browse using just our eyes and fingertips, Korean stores put smell, touch and sound at the forefront.

Dr Jart decided to bring “soft” skin to life with fur-lined walls, giant fluffy sculptures and pink swings. This theme extended to a branded karaoke room in the middle of the building. Fluffy pink microphones and branded speakers were offered for no reason other than to entertain.

A skincare-themed rooftop trampoline park was built with viewing platforms that made for the perfect aerial shot. In minutes, I was uploading footage to Instagram of me jumping with Dr Jart’s signature product ‘Cirapair’ at my feet.

Dr Jart crafted a sensory experience that was thrilling for the consumer, but equally irresistible to share on social. This and many other spaces were designed shared, meaning the physical store became a media channel in itself. To transform an owned asset into a shared one, brands sought inspiration from their consumers, manufacturing the space with the question: how can we guarantee that this space will be seen by more than just the person in it?

Korean stores treated the consumer journey as a sacred treasure hunt. Even the most banal transactions (e.g. stepping into a store or receiving a bag from a shop assistant), were made into moments of delight.

For example, Ader Error’s latest collection was centred on nostalgic VHS video tapes, yet rather than keep this hidden on some mood board in a designers studio, the inspiration was embedded in every detail:

1. At the door, I was greeted by a two metre sculpture of a Yeti made entirely of strips of camera film and surrounded by branded VHS tapes. 

2. Upon closer inspection, the film strips were actually sourced from the shooting of their SS20 Autumn collection. 

3. Custom film posters decorated the store, announcing their designers as ‘directors’ of the collection

4. Following the trail of film, I discovered a storeroom that had been transformed into an actual movie theatre where I watch behind-the-scenes filming of the new collection 

5. When I purchased a shirt, it was packaged with a custom film poster along with an actual strip of film from the exhibition. 

6. My receipt was delicately folded, with my surname and smiley face handwritten on the top; a small gesture that transformed a formerly transactional symbol into a personal exchange.

While packaging can seem like a small afterthought, these Korean brands saw it as a major opportunity to transform a retail necessity into branded cultural keepsakes. Creating a sense of scarcity and attaching money-can’t-buy memories to a physical purchase makes the labour of a store visit worth it.

In Australia, "try before you buy" is a behavioral habit that isn’t going anywhere. Rather than lament this behavior, Korean retail aggressively encourages it.

Facing a future like Korea where a quarter of all purchases are made online, Australian brands should consider how physical elements (from store space to packaging) can be a meaningful media channel within an online purchase path.

We’ve already seen the Korean wave exert its influence on western music, films and beauty regimes. Yet when next seeking inspiration from the east, don’t just think K-POP, think K-Shop.

Blessed with an angelic voice—a listen to her soulful hit “Through the Night” showcases her talents perfectly—and charisma to spare, she’s become one of South Korea’s most popular celebrities. In the spotlight for over a decade, her persona evolved from pop princess next door to multi-faceted and innovative artist. As likely to headline a Netflix series (in 2019 she lead the artsy anthology, Persona) as she is to drop a single, IU proves that being an idol is about much more than music.

Naturally, fashion giants like Gucci have fallen for her. A newly-minted Michele muse, IU looked right at home alongside the Milan Fashion Week regulars. It takes skill to pull off Michele’s stylized creations, but she’s proven herself adept at transforming runway styles to suit her tastes. Spotted at Seoul’s Incheon Airport earlier this week in a sweeping tartan cape and turtleneck combo, she gave the dramatic piece a touch of real-world charm. Likewise, today’s ethereal look also received an update thanks to the addition of a bedazzled butterfly choker—an adorable accessory for a charming new front-row star.THE spike in Covid-19 cases has impacted South Korea’s show business with K-pop groups having to drop their events.

China Press reported that K-pop girl group Twice (pic) had to cancel their concert on March 7 and 8 in Seoul.

JYP Entertainment released a statement saying that the cancellation was inevitable as the safety of the artistes and their fans was an utmost priority.

Payment for the tickets would be reimbursed as soon as possible.

As for BTS, the boy band was supposed to attend a press conference at Starfield Coex Mall in Gangnam, Seoul, to promote their new album Map of the Soul: 7.

Instead, the press conference was conducted via a live broadcast.

To date, South Korea has recorded more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases.

Where a paragraph begins with this ' >'sign, it denotes a separate news item.EXO's Chen has broken countless hearts with his announcement that he plans to marry his girlfriend.

The music video for one of their debut songs 'Boombayah' has crossed 800M views on YouTube, becoming the first K-pop debut music video to do so.

It joins the ranks of BTS' 'DNA' and another one of BLACKPINK's songs 'DDU-DU DDU-DU' as one of the few KPop group music videos to reach the 800M milestone. It has taken 'Boombayah' over three years to achieve the milestone, but follow-up song 'DDU-DU DDU-DU' crossed the 1 billion mark in only a year. More recently, BLACKPINK's 'Kill This Love' broke the record for most views within the first 24 hours after its release and is nearing the 800M mark just as it approaches its 1st year anniversary.

Needless to say, BLACKPINK is no stranger to breaking records and making history. Given that the girls have a limited discography to their name, their accomplishments are admirable. They might even break PSY's record with 'Gangnam Style'. Considering that PSY's record has over 3.5B views though, it might take them another year or two to get there.

But their monumental success right from their debut makes it quite understandable that their fandom, BLINKs, are eagerly awaiting a documentary on the band and their journey to the top. Netflix may have indirectly confirmed that BLACKPINK may just get a special feature soon.

While browsing around Netflix and casually looking up 'BLACKPINK', as one does, BLINKs discovered something interesting: an 'Untitled Blackpink Feature Documentary' appears as a related title.

A BLINK quickly jumped on Twitter to ask Netflix, "what date is the blackpink feature documentary being released?" to which the platform's account tweeted back "Hey, thanks for reaching out! We currently don't have any info on when that'll be released. Make sure to follow our social handle for updates though!" And as would be expected, BLINKs lost their collective minds.

BLACKPINK's agency YG Entertainment has been at the receiving end of an immense amount of hatred over the last decade. The company's top boy group, BigBang, were dealt a blow when member Seungri was accused of enabling sexual assault and participating in illicit foreign exchange transactions as part of the Burning Sun scandal. It also lost credibility and money when CEO Yang Hyun-suk was pulled up on similar charges. Not long before the controversy, top girl group 2NE1 disbanded following allegations of mismanagement, something fans have accused the company of repeating with their current top girl group BLACKPINK.

Despite their obvious appeal and the fact that everything they put out seems to be a hit, BLINKs are still left waiting for a full album from one of the top girl groups in the industry. Since no official dates have been released by YG for a comeback or for the rumored Netflix documentary, the wait for more BLACKPINK will continue indefinitely.Kard’s music is a mix of styles, but what does this four-piece K-pop group have that others do not?Kim Yohan took to V Live with new purplish hair after a photo shoot.

A fan commented on one of her tweets writing: “Please answer me Ahlam, will there be a collaboration with BTS?”

“Yes, of course there is,’’ the star, who celebrated her 51st birthday last night, said.

After the star’s response, fans expressed their enthusiasm about the potential partnership with the hashtag “#AhlamxBTS.”

However, Al-Shamsi’s confirmation was not enough for supporters of the artists. They were curious about the topic of the song and its language.

“What will an Arab-Korean song have to say,” one user commented.

Others questioned the credibility of it all. “Ahlam, are you really collaborating (with them) or is this a joke?” a fan wrote.

Al-Shamsi, the coach of the “The Voice: Ahla Sawt,” is considered one of the most influential musicians in the Middle East, with over 27 million followers on social media and several chart toping hits.

BTS is the most streamed K-pop band in Saudi Arabia on Spotify. Last year, they had six tracks in the top 10 K-pop list in the UAE and four of the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.

The music genre’s upbeat tempo, painstakingly choreographed dance routines, and colorful visuals have turned it into a global phenomenon, despite the language barrier.

BTS recently launched a mobile simulation application, “BTS World,” which allows players to become the group’s manager (in the virtual world — and without real-life cash).K-pop girl group ELRIS has made a comeback with the new album "JACKPOT" after adding two new members to the group.



The agency Hunus Entertainment said earlier this month that the group recruited two new members ― EJ and Chaejeong ― and would be releasing its fourth album as a seven-member outfit. 



The new album is dance-pop genre, with the concept of tough teen girls, which is a change from the group's previous bright, sparkly images. 



The group originally planned to hold a media showcase on the album's release day. But the agency called it off Tuesday due to the coronavirus spike in the country. 



Instead, the group decided to hold a fan event through streaming platform V Live on the day. 



ELRIS debuted in 2017 with five members ― Bella, Hyesung, Yukyung, Sohee and Karin. Sohee's debut drew interest because she was a semifinalist in SBS's popular audition show "K-pop Star" season 6. 



The latest album was released at 6 p.m. Wednesday through online streaming sites.
• Starbucks recently partnered with K-pop group BTS in South Korea, debuting new menu items and merchandise.
• The all-purple menu includes items such as Purple Berry Cheesecake and Blooming Purple Vin Chaud.
• A visit to Starbucks in Seoul reveals that the partnership between BTS and the coffee giant is a success — and one the chain should think about replicating in the US.

SEOUL, South Korea — BTS is one of the biggest music industry icons worldwide.

The K-pop group earned $57 million in pre-tax income in 2019. It is responsible for a whopping $3.6 billion boost to South Korea's economy, and it is expected to bring in $37 billion over the next decade, according to the Hyundai Research Institute. The Washington Post reports you can buy BTS-branded Puma track suits, BTS face masks, and even a BTS-themed deck of UNO.

Now, there is finally a BTS menu at Starbucks.

On a recent trip to Starbucks in Seoul, South Korea, the all-purple BTS-branded menu was front and center at the coffee giant. So, I decided to see if Starbucks could match the BTS hype.The BYUSA K-pop Club gives students of different backgrounds opportunities to enjoy the culture and movement of K-pop music.

Around 30 to 40 students from all over Utah County come to K-pop club every Thursday to share their love for dance and K-pop music. This love has created an uplifting environment that has allowed students to exercise without even realizing it.

K-pop is a genre of music that originated in South Korea. Over the past few years, it has begun breaking into American mainstream music, with several K-pop groups making Billboard’s top 200.

BYU student Alex Bollinger founded the club to create a space for K-pop lovers around campus to get together, dance and enjoy the music.

Students can come any time and are welcomed by current members. Bollinger said she makes it a priority to go up to all new members and make sure they know they have a place in the club.

“I want to create a place where everyone feels welcome,” Bollinger said. “The class is definitely open to all levels of dance. Beginners come in and say ‘Oh I can’t come to this class.’ Of course you can. We’re just here to have fun and not to have any judgment.”

BYU student and K-pop Club Vice President Ana Contreras joined the club initially because of her love of the music but has grown to enjoy dancing as well.

“It got me out of my comfort zone and got me moving,” Contreras said. “It’s something I never thought I would do before.”

Members are able to volunteer to teach others dances they have learned every Thursday night. During BYU student Isaac McDougal’s first time at K-pop club, he taught a TWICE dance called “Cheer Up.”

“Seriously anyone can do it,” McDougal said. “I think the dances are a perfect level of difficulty. I see people in there who have zero dancing skills and can still get the basic moves. It’s more for fun and it’s way less pressure.”

Membership has grown more than the founders imagined.

“Although we had been promoting (the club) a lot, we didn’t expect it to be that big,” Contreras said. “We didn’t know there were that many closeted K-pop fans.”

Those interested in learning more about the club can visit the club’s social media @byukpopclub.The bandmates of BTS continued playing their own version of Monopoly in the 94th episode of “Run BTS!” shot during their trip to London.Each had moments of strengths and weaknesses: Jimin turned out to be extraordinarily good at one-stroke pattern drawing while RM got the name of Brazilian capital city wrong.

This year, the South Korean music phenomenon will make its mark on the country again thanks to a star-studded concert in March featuring some of K-Pop’s biggest stars. And that’s not all; Global Village’s latest addition to its Season 24 entertainment line-up is none other than a musical titled ‘K-Pop Krazy’.

Here’s what you need to know about the K-Pop-themed show that is set to take over the world, one country at a time:

1. It’s the first K-Pop musical of its kind

The musical is a K-Pop show in itself — without the fan chants, banners and light sticks, of course. It’s the world’s first dance and musical production to hit the local and international market, giving visitors an idea of the multibillion dollar K-Pop industry. Hailing from Seoul, the show features 14 members that range between 18 and 29 years of age.

2. It’s about the quest for stardom

The road to K-Pop stardom in highly regulated Korean entertainment agencies isn’t for the faint-hearted, but ‘K-Pop Krazy’ offers a short, light-hearted and entertaining glimpse of the pop phenomenon shaking up the world. It is centred around young talents on a quest for international fame.

The musical may be about aspiring idols — which is how K-Pop stars are referred to in Korea — but the show already has a performer with experience in the highly competitive music scene.

Signed under JTG Entertainment, Seoyul has been part of girl group Berry Good since 2015. Her sister is the well-known singer Yuna from group AOA. Seoyul is the first K-Pop idol to participate in a musical production of this kind.

4. It’s a little less talk and a little more singing and dancing

The entirety of the musical is in Korean, but it’s predominantly all singing and dancing that needs no translation. Much like K-Pop itself, ‘K-Pop Krazy’ is accompanied by catchy songs, sleek choreography, coordinated fashion and photogenic young stars. The boy and girl groups light up Global Villages’ Main Stage with their own musical dance numbers, showing off their vocal skills and perfectly in synch choreographies while dressed in school uniforms. Yet for the encore performance, all the performers conclude the musical by dancing off to Psy’s 2012 mega hit, ‘Gangnam Style’.

5. It’s slated to embark on an international tour

Dubai’s Global Village was its exclusive international launch pad before the musical sets on an international tour. The musical kick-started in Dubai from January 13 until February 3, with performances held three times daily with Fridays as an exception. The ‘K-Pop Krazy’ act has even launched their own YouTube channel, documenting their performances, practices and adventures in Dubai.The challenge also went viral with K-pop fans from in and outside of the country, with some 100,000 videos of fans taking the dance challenge uploaded in the first ten days since the song's official release.The story goes that Dionysus, ancient Greek god of wine and theater, was born twice: once in a storm of passion and lightning that ripped him from his mortal mother Semele, and again from a gap in his immortal father Zeus's thigh. It's been said that he forwent a life on Mount Olympus to live amongst humans, traveling the world and amassing a loyal cult of female followers known as maenads, or "raving ones," with his intoxicating persona. Dionysus is a symbol of contrast; a deity culled from human flesh and bone, born as one archetype yet destined to live as another.

Perhaps that's what makes him such a compelling figure for BTS, the Korean septet whose own extraordinary mythos seems as if it was forged in the cosmos. Addressing the United Nations in September 2018, leader RM said, "Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser and that would be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life." No matter how high they climb within the pop pantheon — becoming the first Korean artists to perform at the Grammys, scoring three consecutive album debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart — they remain true to their Bangtan roots.

"Dionysus" is the closing track on their 2019 album Map of the Soul: Persona, and it's featured on its follow-up, Map of the Soul: 7. Produced by member J-Hope, its rousing and unrefined prog rock served as the opening number of BTS’s Love Yourself: Speak Yourself world tour last year, which spanned stadiums across Europe, Asia, and North and South America, earning a staggering $116.6 million. With overt lyrical references to the gluttonous god — "Thyrsus (grippin’) Grape (eatin’)" — the track meditates on the perils of intoxicating fame through the lens of a veritable party anthem. "Art at this level is over-drinking," Suga raps, translated into English. "The new record is the fight against oneself." It’s a recurring theme throughout BTS’s oeuvre: Being at the top means they’re only in competition with themselves, but every milestone may lead to new disappointments. It's a limitless feeling that's both invigorating and empty.

On "Home," a smooth R&B cut from the same album, Suga also addresses this confusing feeling: "Even if we have what I wanted in my dreams / Big house, big cars, big rings," he spits, nodding to “No More Dream,” their 2013 debut single. "The unfamiliar feeling of missing something / For someone who has accomplished everything."

BTS closed their Love Yourself chapter with a series of concerts at Olympic Stadium in Seoul, but they continued to perform "Dionysus" at year-end awards shows. It served as the explosive finale to an impressive 40-minute set at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in December; days before, at the 2019 Melon Music Awards, the seven members transformed into Greek deities for their performance. They even brought Dionysia, a celebratory festival dedicated to Dionysus, to the stage at this year's Golden Disk Awards, hinting at the feast’s imminent return with the cryptic message "City Dionysia Begins" (likely a reference to their forthcoming Map of the Soul world tour). For BTS, the godly comparison is less of a flex and more a symbol of their own story. They are, after all, the dramatis personae in a folktale of their own masterful making.

The threads of this narrative, which members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook have been constructing visually since at least 2015, are sewn throughout their music videos and discography. But the "Bangtan Universe" extends beyond a singular story; these images — evoked through lyrics, apps, Bangtan Bombs, and concert films — define the group as they are seen through the eyes of their dedicated fans. Persona deals with this phenomenon head-on, expanding the BTS story as they're confronted with many different versions of themselves. "Intro: Persona" finds leader and rapper RM grappling with this crisis of identity ("Who the hell am I?") over a sample of 2014’s "Intro: Skool Luv Affair" in a throwback but also a push forward: "The me that I want myself to be / The me that people want me to be / The me that you love / And the me that I create / The me that's smiling / The me that's sometimes in tears," RM raps.

But a persona isn't just the “me” one presents to the world; it's a mask, and this is a recurring motif in BTS’s iconography. Take their performance at the 2019 Golden Disc Awards, where they all removed physical veils while isolated in individual shadow boxes; and in the video for "Interlude: Shadow," off the forthcoming Map of the Soul: 7, Suga is surrounded by disguised onlookers cloaked in black, illuminated by the lights of their smartphones. But it isn't always so explicit. In the Persona song "Jamais Vu," eldest member Jin alludes to the metaphorical camouflage we wear daily, singing, "I'm fine but I'm not fine / I told myself I was used to it." It’s both a nod to Dionysus, known as the "masked god" who reigns over the theater, and a means to further interrogate the performative line between artist and idol.

BTS continues to grapple with that distinction, which is significant as veterans of the K-pop industry, in which musicians are put on pedestals to be worshipped and admired as idols, not unlike the Greek gods themselves. In their single "Idol," RM proclaims that he "doesn't care" what you call him — artist or otherwise — because he is his best when he is simply himself. "Dionysus" builds on this realization. "Born as a K-pop idol / Reborn as an artist / Reborn as an artist, reborn as an artist," Suga raps. "What does it matter if I’m an idol or an artist, cheers." This idea of rebirth and reinvention is inherent to the lore surrounding both BTS and Dionysus, a god known for “experimenting with identities,” according to Johanna Hanink, a writer and classicist at Brown University.

"It's not just about artistry, it's about trying to move beyond the constraints of being a K-pop idol," Seoul-based writer Yung-In Chae tells MTV News. "Alcohol becomes a metaphor to become something that's beyond yourself. In the song 'Dionysus,' they like to think of their art as having similar effects. It's about going behind the boundaries of yourself."

The more they create, the more intoxicating it becomes. "There's a lot of ancient Greek poetry about how being out and partying is one of two ways that you can relieve yourself from the weight of the world, that you can forget your cares," Hanink tells MTV News. "The other one is listening to good poetry, so listening to songs. These are the two things that humans can do to temporarily forget what a difficult place the world is, and both of those fall into Dionysus's domain. It seems like a perfect synthesis in BTS's lyrics."

In many ways, that's why people connect to the art BTS creates. Like any good fable, the messages woven into their music contextualize the world around them. Songs like "Go Go," "Dope," and "Silver Spoon (Baepsae)" address the frustrations of young people who feel like the system is rigged against them. "Paradise" and "No More Dream" preach that you don't need to live life chasing a dream that isn't yours. And their most recent single, "Black Swan," expresses their deepest fears: that the work they create might one day cease to mean anything at all.

"Korea's a very hard place to be young in a lot of ways," Chae says. "We have an aging population, a high youth unemployment rate. In a lot of their music, like 'Silver Spoon,' they purposely address these generational struggles. It's really hard to sell a song that is not a love song in [Korean] pop music… It's hard to imagine that people want to hear a song about the struggles of the youth. It's not as sexy, but they do that."

Yet it's never didactic. That's an essential rule of myth-building: Meaning is up for interpretation and dissection. As BTS constructs their own story, their connection to Dionysus, driven by emotions and instinct, becomes clear. Map of the Soul: 7 has many meanings for the group, as RM has previously stated. The seven members of BTS have been together for seven years. Seven could be a divine number, a lucky number, or it may hint at a uniquely Dionysian philosophy where the self is surrendered to the whole, seven billion souls becoming a single universe.

On February 2, J-Hope dropped the outro track from 7, "Ego." Throughout the video, J-Hope reflects on the path that led him to BTS, the hardships and bouts of self-doubt that nearly derailed him, by incorporating old BTS music videos, callbacks to their debut single, and childhood photos. Through trusting himself and fate, J-Hope finds himself in a sprawling, colorful city where the words "Hope," "Trust Myself," and "My Way" twinkle in the darkness. One word, "ARMY," stands out. A reference to the group's legion of fans around the world, it visualizes a universe in which they walk next to BTS, like the maenads who traveled the globe alongside Dionysus — never behind him. He wasn't merely a god to be worshipped; he liberated his companions and, in turn, they devoted themselves to him.

It's easy to look at BTS and deem them gods among men, atop their heap of accomplishments and accolades. From an outsider's perspective, their myth precedes them; seven underdogs from a small company who made something out of nothing. They're nearly immortal. But what brought them to this apex was their humanity, their ability to empathize with everyday struggles and empower those around them to love themselves and speak their truths. BTS are gods, but they make everyone else feel like gods too. It's not a party if you're the only one allowed on the mountain.Zico’s Any Song has become a TikTok craze, IU’s Blueming is still in the top 10, Hwasa remains a powerful force – which K-pop soloists will make it big this year?Korean KPop group BTS has somehow taken over the iTunes charts. All 20 songs from their new album are now lodged at numbers 1 through 20. This is, insane. Maybe it’s “Parasite” fans, who knows?

The top two songs are “On” and another version of “On” with Sia as the featured singer. Justin Bieber’s song, “Intentions” has been knocked down to number 26.

BTS has done this before with iTunes, and it’s always been questioned. Are their fans gaming the system? So far, none of those songs has turned up on Apple Music’s streaming service, which makes me wonder: who’s exactly listening to this stuff? If it’s not streaming at all, it could mean the fans are just “stuffing the ballot box” as it were, and jamming iTunes with multiple sales.

A lot of money is invested in the success of BTS. We’ll see how long this latest incursion lasts. Real numbers will be available by Sunday.Chen from Exo caused an uproar when he recently announced his upcoming marriage.Seven hours before the K-pop band SuperM took the stage for their sold-out show at the Forum last week, crowds were already packed outside the venue. No one needed to be there so early. The unseasonably hot weather sent sweat down fans’ faces — many covered with surgical masks, perhaps from coronavirus fears — and dampened their SuperM sweatshirts, SuperM T-shirts and SuperM proprietary lightsticks.

But thousands of young K-pop stans had waited months for this day, when an unprecedented supergroup of South Korea’s top pop stars would headline Los Angeles as part of a U.S. and worldwide arena tour.

The boys were just steps away, in fact, down the Forum Club stairs, past the giant portraits of Bob Dylan and Guns N’ Roses, in a windlowless backstage green room. There, SuperM’s Taemin, Kai, Baekhyun, Mark, Ten and Lucas (all early to mid-20s), kicked back on a gigantic couch, dressed in Balenciaga sweatshirts and high-streetwear bomber jackets. Their green, blue and bleach-blond hair fell over skin so flawless it looked like they’d had Instagram filters implanted.

Taeyong, the seventh, was a bit worse for wear, clutching his stomach in agony from an unspecified illness. He powered through the shivering to silently nod hello to a Times reporter, before beelining back to the dressing room to recover. Still, the band felt prepared for the night.

“I was really nervous when I first went on that stage, I actually didn’t have too much confidence,” Lucas said, about the band’s first-ever live show outside the offices of their U.S. label Capitol back in October (all members but Mark used a translator for English interviews). “A lot of the nervousness came from the fact that I really wanted to put my best foot forward. But now, I can definitely say I feel more confident about where I am.”

Super M’s only been a group for six months, but they were as surefire an idea as any in pop. Its members had been K-pop stars for nearly their whole lives, in the groundbreaking groups EXO, SHINee, NCT127 and WayV. In the wake of BTS’ rout of the U.S. pop charts and stadiums, SuperM is already tipped as the next phenomenon in K-pop, with four popular bands’ fan bases built in, and both Capitol and SM Entertainment, the most storied label in K-pop from founder Lee Soo-Man, behind them.

In October, the band set a record for debut week sales by a K-pop act, and topped the Billboard 200 album charts with their self-titled EP.

But they’ve also endured tragedy, including the 2017 suicide of Jonghyun, Taemin’s bandmate in SHINee. These seven young men, none older than 27, face the all-consuming demands of K-pop celebrity and an industry going through a time of profound self-reflection and change.

As they limbered up for this set — maybe the biggest show of their young careers in this band — they knew the stakes.

“This is basically like the re-debut for a lot of us,” Kai said. “There is some of that pressure and that expectation on us, because there was a kind of shock value to this group. This is going to be a different kind of stage.”

In K-pop, it’s common for bands to be modular. Groups often have sub-units or spinoffs to appeal to different markets like Chinese speakers. It’s especially helpful for boy bands, where superstardom is no insulation from compulsory military service in South Korea, and acts can be reconfigured to keep stars on the road.

But nothing like SuperM has happened in the genre before, where standout members of already superfamous bands joined forces. “The Avengers of K-pop” comparisons come up often, but maybe instead think of the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball “Dream Team,” with seven-part harmonies and two-hour sets of impeccable choreography.

Even though all the members are in their twenties, in the ultra-compressed world of K-pop, SuperM is intergenerational. “I used to listen to SHINee before I even came to the label to train,” Mark, 20, said, looking over admiringly at his bandmate Taemin, 26. “To have our voices be harmonized together, and to be able to see him as a guy I know as a friend, that changes the way I listen to his music or see his performance.”

Being in the new band was also a chance to break out of the established roles in their main acts. “In EXO, I’m one of the youngest, but here I’m one of the oldest and that’s a really fun dynamic,” Kai, 26, said. “When I look at Lucas, I remember back when I first debuted and that makes me feel young again, like ‘Oh, I remember when I was like that too’.”

“Men get more attractive as they get older, so it’s kind of better to debut later,” 21-year-old Lucas joked, ribbing his bandmate in return.

SuperM isn’t diluted for Western tastes. But they are particularly rangy for K-pop: At their Forum show, Taemin, one of the older members and a K-pop veteran since 2008, sang pristine R&B on “Goodbye” and nailed every mark of a long, complicated solo dance. Kai’s trap-influenced “Confession” was the raciest number, punctuated by long flashes of abs that sent fans into paroxysms of lust.

“The genre as a whole is exploding over here,” said Tarynn Law, 27, who works at a music tech firm in Malibu and ponied up $175 for a floor seat to the Forum show. “Artists like Taemin and EXO haven’t toured here in quite some time or, in WayV’s case, at all, which makes SuperM’s love for the States pretty special for a lot of fans, too.”

The group’s new material — the purring melodic bounce of “No Manners” and the hard-pivoting EDM of “Jopping” (a goofy portmanteau of “Jumping” and “Popping”) — show an ear for K-pop sounds that can translate not just globally, but specifically on U.S. streaming and arena tours.

“I personally think that this group itself is not really westernized or altered at all for any type of market,” said Baekhyun. But he agrees that their sound challenges both K-pop and Western styles. “To be honest, when I first heard the song ‘Jopping,’ I thought it sounded a little bit too different. But now when I see the U.S. or the international fans’ reaction, it really made an impression on them. There was a bigger picture that Mr. Lee was thinking of.”

After helping to push NCT127 to the top tier of K-pop acts in the U.S., Capitol sees SuperM as both the most promising new bet in K-pop today, and the start of a deeper relationship with the Korean label SM Entertainment and its founder Lee Soo-Man, at 67 a titanic figure in South Korean business and culture (imagine Steve Jobs or Marvel’s Kevin Feige, if they’d invented a music genre that became their country’s most visible export).

Given K-pop’s uniquely devoted fan culture, where physical record sales are an expression of loyalty and fans camp out to buy $70 avant-garde sweatshirts, it’s no surprise that Capitol wanted to continue what “Mr. Lee,” as he is affectionately known in South Korea, had started.

“Like many music executives, I’ve watched with keen interest how K-pop’s immense popularity has been spreading around the globe,” Steve Barnett, the chairman and CEO of Capitol Music Group, said in an email. “I’ve certainly wanted to be in this space for a while, but I knew I had to find the right partner. Mr. Lee is an incredibly impressive and successful entertainment executive and creative force. Everything is first rate with his company and the artists he develops and brings to the world.”

Indeed, Mr. Lee, who hand-picked the members of SuperM, was at the Forum show, and when the camera panned to him in his suite, he was cheered as loudly as any star on stage. Given BTS’ “Saturday Night Live” and Grammy performances, Blackpink’s knockout set at Coachella last year and the reunion of veteran K-pop act BigBang this year at the same fest, the genre and its figureheads have never been more visible in the U.S.

But the squeaky-clean scene has, over the last few years, faced many of the same reckonings about overwork, toxic fan culture, misogyny and mental health that the wider entertainment industry has dealt with. Last year, K-pop was shaken by the suicides of two female stars, Goo Hara and Sulli, that thrust those long-simmering issues to the forefront.

Taemin knows that sense of tragedy more intimately than anyone. As a founding member of SHINee, he was devastated by the suicide of his bandmade Jonghyun in 2017. The loss shook K-pop as a whole, including all the members of SuperM. But Taemin lost a bandmate and close friend. He still struggles with how to speak about it, and when the topic came up, a Capitol rep encouraged him to be as honest as he felt comfortable with. He wanted to keep the personal pain of that loss private, he said, but acknowledged that speaking out on mental health issues in K-pop is the only way to effect change.

“When it comes to celebrities, it’s always kind of a double-edged sword. They’re loved by so many, but at the same time, they’re in the spotlight and everything they do is analyzed or scrutinize by so many people,” Taemin said. “But the industry is definitely changing for the better.”

In a few hours, they would walk out to a packed Forum and show fans what K-pop is capable of. For two hours, they demonstrated the virtuosity, musical range and physical craft that goes into a set pushing the peak of a genre. As a cultural phenomenon, K-pop has nothing left to prove in America anymore. Now it’s up to its acts to show what’s possible within it.

”It’s really encouraging to see how we can all bridge the gap, and everyone can just be part of a global music scene,” Kai said. “This shows us that K-pop is not just for K-pop fans anymore.”Fans may be in for a double treat of K-Pop soon. South Korean music show ‘Music Bank’ is reportedly taking its world tour to Dubai next month.

South Korean online platform Naver first broke the news of a Music Bank show in Dubai on Saturday, revealing that the KBS 2TV programme’s concert series will take place at the Coca-Cola Arena on March 21.

It also revealed popular acts Twice, Monsta X, Seventeen, Exo’s Baekhyun, and GOT7’s unit Jus2 will be performing at the 15th stop of the music show’s world tour, with more artists yet to be announced.

Gulf News tabloid! reached out to Coca-Cola Arena for confirmation but a representative is unable to comment at the moment. However, it didn’t take long for social media-savvy fans to share their enthusiasm in hopes of seeing their favourite acts.

Since 2001, the South Korean TV show has hosted overseas concert series in various cities in Japan, France, Vietnam, Germany, Chile and Turkey, among others.

The rumours follows the arena’s announcement that they would host a concert titled K-Pop Super Concert on March 20. Super Junior will headline the gig along with performances from groups NCT 127 and Laboum, reggae duo RGP and soloist Jun.

It also comes after Korean entertainment and broadcasting as a whole has taken precautionary measures to halt or postpone activities until further notice due to the Coronavirus crisis.

The weekly live music show KBS Music Bank announced that its Friday broadcast would be held without a live studio audience and reportedly suspended its pre-show arrival press photo session for health and safety reasons.

KBS’s Music Bank is considered one of the most popular music programmes in South Korea. So, the possibility of UAE hosting the renowned show speaks volumes about K-Pop’s popularity.

Its last overseas tour stop was in Hong Kong last year, featuring Park Bo-gum, Twice’s Dahyun and celebrity Janis Chan as MCs for the night.It is the only mixed-gender idol group on the K-pop scene today, which has been pulling off diverse sonic styles ranging from tropical to moombahton ― a blend of reggae and electro house. 

 The four-piece group has experimented from its beginnings in 2016, diving into genres that were not yet in vogue in Korea. But thanks to the genres' worldwide popularity and the band's compelling performances, KARD rose to global stardom and formed a solid international fandom, especially in South America. It has played numerous concerts outside Korea as well. 

 But this engendered a misunderstanding that the group solely focuses on the overseas market. Thus, many domestic fans have been calling on it to juggle its career in Korea too. The four members ― J.Seph, BM, Somin and Jiwoo ― are well aware of this and they revealed they also crave to seize more opportunities here.

"We also want more engagement in musical activities here," Jiwoo said in an interview with The Korea Times at a cafe in Seongsu-dong, Tuesday. "An official from a Korean broadcasting station recently told us that KARD was like a fictional group to him (as we rarely make a public appearance in Korea). He said he was so surprised to bump into us." 

 She added: "Legions of people, including our fans, are also telling us to be more active in Korea. We would like to do so and have asked our management company DSP Media for more chances." 

 J.Seph said he felt sorry for domestic followers, because the band had to embark on a world tour soon after releasing "Dumb Litty" in September. The quartet could not meet lots of Korean fans then. Hence, he wants more meet-ups this time. 

 KARD dropped its fourth mini-album "RED MOON," fronted by the lead track of the same name, on Wednesday. The number is a catchy combination of moombahton, trap and EDM, which likens the steamy chemistry to the red moon. 

 "We came back with a moombahton-flavored song to display KARD's unique charm once again," Somin said. She was mostly reserved during the interview, but was eager to speak up when the reporters asked about KARD's music. 



"In the beginning, we chose moombahton because of its trendiness," Jiwoo said. "As our moombahton-based tracks gained popularity, many listeners began linking the genre to KARD." 

 BM, who contributed to the composing and lyrics of B-side tracks, said the band was not yet ready to make a dramatic shift in its music. 

 "While tuning up for the album, we had to decide whether to adhere to our original style or take a risk," he said. "But frankly speaking, we were afraid of tackling a fresh challenge. I believe more time and practice are needed." 

 Although KARD is known for its breathlessly powerful choreography in its releases including "Hola Hola" (2017) and "Bomb Bomb" (2019), the band has a thirst for singing. 

 "I want to try filling the stage only with our voices, without any dance movements," Somin passionately said. 

 Jiwoo agreed, saying: "We once covered 'thank u, next' (2018) ― sung by pop star Ariana Grande ― in our concert without dancing. But our audience was still fond of it."

 Meanwhile, the four-member group is facing a big change this year ― J.Seph, 27, is set to join the Army. 

 "I am quite anxious about serving compulsory military service, because I am afraid of being together with strangers," he said. 

 Hence, KARD's goal this time is to make as many public appearances as possible and accomplish musical feats before the rapper's enlistment.

 "While he is away, the remaining members will make use of the time to grow up," Somin said."We would like to advise fans to refrain from visiting the venue of the press conference for your own safety, and ask you to support BTS by watching the press conference via livestreaming."Samsung has inked a new partnership with Kpop super band BTS to promote its new smartphones. BTS is a massive global entity in its own right with countless fans across the globe. This partnership will allow Samsung to reach out to a younger demographic which makes up a significant chunk of the BTS fan base.

As part of this collaboration, Samsung will first support the band’s global contemporary art initiative called CONNECT BTS, before expanding the partnership to other initiatives. It wouldn’t be surprising if BTS members start appearing in commercials for Samsung products.

Samsung teams up with BTS to promote its smartphones

Samsung has a history of leveraging the massive reach that Kpop bands have for marketing purposes. It most recently worked with another super band Blackpink for the launch of the Galaxy A80. Not only was the girl group retained to promote the device, Samsung even launched a Galaxy A80 Blackpink Edition in select markets.

Samsung has not detailed exactly what shape its marketing efforts with BTS will take but industry insiders expect the boy band to participate in Samsung’s promotion and marketing events for the Galaxy Z Flip and the Galaxy S20 lineup. BTS member V was also spotted at Samsung’s Unpacked event for these devices in San Francisco.

BTS is perhaps the biggest and most globally recognized Kpop bands in history. Aligning its products with this band will enable Samsung to get its message out to a younger demographic across the globe.

“We hope we can deliver a good experience to fans of BTS and Galaxy devices around the globe through collaboration with BTS,” said a Samsung official, adding that “We are planning various activities other than ‘CONNECT BTS.'”On February 12, 2019, a fresh and powerful wave of talent took over the world. The mystically synchronized K-pop girl group ITZY emerged, with a splash of their “DALLA DALLA” -- the title for their debut single, meaning different in Korean. ITZY’s self-love anthem positioned the band, signed to JYP Entertainment, for worldwide success and the premiere of the “DALLA DALLA” music video became the quickest to reach 100 million views in K-pop history.

The powerhouse group is comprised of members Yeji (19), Lia (19), Ryujin (18), Chaeryeong (18), and Yuna, (16) and they have a clear message they want to spread all over the world: being exactly who you are is more than enough. In the saturated world of K-pop, standing out is key to success, and their lyrics focus on breaking out from socially accepted norms and letting your uniqueness take over. “Don't measure me by your standards alone/ I love being myself/ I'm nobody else,” Lia sings in Korean on “DALLA DALLA”.

Clearly, they’re doing something right. ITZY have a dedicated group of stans, called MIDZY, who not only enjoy their upbeat tunes, slick routines and killer visuals, but also the strong message behind their music and every single concept they put out there. Thousands of their fans lined up for hours outside of Brooklyn’s Kings Theatre for the group's first-ever showcase in New York City. “It’s just a matter of playing one of their songs for me to start feeling a bit better about myself, and the person I’m growing to be,” says Daisy, a 15-year-old fan who’s been waiting in line since mid-day for the chance to meet the band.

ITZY may have had a big 2019, and come away from end-of-year award ceremonies with a dozen trophies and millions of fans (including Best New Artist), but that doesn’t mean they’ve figured out who they are just yet. While there’s confidence in their songs, they’re all still teenagers. “To tell you the truth, before "DALLA DALLA", before our debut, we weren’t that confident,” Lia, the group’s main vocalist said backstage before the show.

Before they took the stage for the last stop of their “‘Itzy? Itzy!’ IN USA” tour, i-D caught up with the charismatic girl group, who were dressed head to toe in metallic silver looks, to hear all about their record-breaking journey and how they inspire self-confidence in each other.

What goals did you have when you debuted, that you wanted to achieve in your first year?

Yeji: What we wanted was to make a debut, and we did. After that, we said that we wanted to win an award for the best new artist, and we did! We’re so grateful that we won. This year’s been very surreal, truly. So many things have happened and it’s only been a year!

But even when a year may sound like a short time, you guys see each other every single day. What’s part of your off-stage routine that you love to share with each other?

Chaeryeong: Chatting. Since we’re about the same age, it’s natural that we click, so we laugh a lot, and we talk a lot.

Throughout your life, what’s a piece of advice someone gave you that you never forgot?

Ryujin: My father always said to me that whatever happens, happens. It’s been the motto of my life. It’s a powerful quote. Things are gonna happen anyway so you may as well take the risk. Just be confident about it.

There’s lots of confidence in your songs. What’s something that makes you feel confident? Chaeryeong: Yuna. 

 Ryujin: It’s true!



How so? 

 Lia: She’s the most confident member. She compliments us a lot. 

Yuna: Thank you, thank you! 

 Lia: Actually, our songs are about self-confidence and loving ourselves, but to tell you the truth, before “Dalla-Dalla”, before our debut, we weren’t that confident. We didn’t have that much self-confidence compared to now, and I think we gained lots of it after our debut, thanks to our fans. Ryujin: We try to be confident the most that we can, but there are times when we’re not. 

 Lia: During our U.S. Tour... one of our fans said, “Thank you for influencing everyone around the world.” That’s it. Having an impact. That’s what we wanted to do, but we weren’t really sure if it was actually working, and if we were actually doing it right. Now, after this tour, we realized how MIDZY actually got the message in our songs.

You’ve probably taught each other a lot too. What’s something you’ve learned from the person to your left? 

 Yeji: What I’ve learned from Lia, is how she empathizes with people. I often talk to her about my problems and every time I do so, she really listens and empathizes with me, almost as if it was her own problem. She’s so good at comforting people. 

 Lia: Ryujin is, in a way… very different from me, so there are lots of things I learn from her. She’s very cool… she doesn’t burden herself with worries, you know?

You mean being more carefree? 

 Chaeryeong: Exactly. 

 Ryujin: From Chaeryeong, um… There’re so many things. She’s a very patient person, and I wasn’t really patient in the past. Being on the same team, I really learned to be patient from her. And she’s well-spoken. She knows how to talk, how to calm things down. I really want to learn that. 

 Yuna (to Chaeryeong): It’s your turn. 

 Chaeryeong: Yes, I know… Yuna is very different from me and because of that, I always find things to learn from her, even though she’s younger than me. I need to learn more about how Yuna accepts any situation with such positive energy. 

 Yuna: What I’ve learned from Yeji is how gently she treats other people. She’s always so nice to everybody, no exceptions.

What’s something you’d like to explore in the future that you haven’t just yet? Either musically, aesthetically or in your lives. 

 Ryujin: We really like our current concept, but we want to show MIDZY and the world how we’ve grown up and how we mature with time. I think that’s what a new concept will always be for us. Not really trying something just because, but more like continuing to explore our own road, the one we’ve built so far for ourselves.

Just going with the flow. 

 Ryujin: Yes. See where it takes us, no matter what people around think. We build it, we walk it. They keep talking, we keep walking.Kim Jung-yeon, a former member of K-pop group A6P, is making his debut as a trot singer in March. 



The singer's agency VL Entertainment said Kim will release a trot single on Mar. 14. Trot is a genre of Korean old pop music, known for its repetitive rhythm and vocal inflections. 



Kim debuted as a member of A6P in 2015, but it wasn't until recently that he rose to stardom as a contestant in TV Chosun's audition show "Mr. Trot." 



The singer competed up to the quarterfinals but failed to make the next round. The semifinals episode is set to air Thursday.



The show, which has been airing since January, has stirred a trot craze, with its viewership rating continuing to rise. The latest episode rated over 30 percent.Model-turned-actor Sung Joon this year revealed that he married his pregnant girlfriend before his military service in 2018. Photo: @thuggyduck/InstagramSEOUL
• Big Hit Entertainment, the music label of South Korean boyband BTS, has chosen JPMorgan, NH Investment & Securities and others to handle its initial public offering (IPO), according to media reports.

The IPO could be one of the largest in years in the country's entertainment industry, with its total valuation expected to be as high as 6 trillion won (S$6.9 billion), the reports said, citing industry sources.

Big Hit Entertainment has chosen three local brokerage firms - NH Investment & Securities, Korea Investment & Securities and Mirae Asset Daewoo - for the IPO, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as the plan is not public yet. The brokerage firms declined to comment, while JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Founded in 2005, the South Korean talent agency behind global sensation BTS has helped the boyband score mega hits globally and sell out stadiums in the United States. BTS performed at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles last month. It broke into the US market in 2017 and was the first Korean group to win a Billboard music award.

BTS, which just released its new album Map Of The Soul: 7, is set to launch a new world tour in April.

With BTS at the height of its popularity, it would be the right time to go public for Big Hit Entertainment, analysts said. But some are sceptical about the lofty valuation.

"The band members who are in their twenties must enlist for compulsory military service in a few years," said Hyundai Motor Securities analyst Yoo Sung-man.

Big Hit Entertainment's "valuable assets in their prime will be out of business for a while in the foreseeable future".

Founder Bang Si-hyuk held the biggest stake of about 43.06 per cent in Big Hit Entertainment as of the end of 2018, followed by gaming company Netmarble Corp's 25.22 per cent, according to a regulatory filing by the music label. Its operating profit nearly doubled to 64.1 billion won in 2018 from the year before, according to the filing.Big Hit Entertainment, the South Korean powerhouse behind BTS and TXT among others, has revealed its latest growth stats. Its revenues in 2019 topped ₩587.9bn ($494m), doubling those in 2018, and it had operating profits of ₩97.5bn ($82m).

Billboard was covering the media announcement in Seoul where the company outlined what it called its “winning formula”. This included expansion in its live operations (including live streaming and cinema broadcasts of shows, including 5.5m viewers of BTS’s concerts) and pop-up shops and experiential spaces to slipstream the BTS touring juggernaut. There was also a diversification of its core business, notably the launch of the Weply and Weverse apps).

Big Hit announced that boyband Seventeen will be heavily pushed through fan interaction app Weverse, which leans on in-app purchasing. The company also unveiled its plans for boyband Belift to launch this year and another new boyband to arrive in 2022. A new girlgroup is already also the works.

BTS, of course, remains the biggest act on the roster and the others will be designed to slipstream their phenomenal global success. Interestingly, there are lots of spin-off products planned around the BTS brand – notably a BTS-themed TV drama, “graphic lyrics” picture books and a Learn Korean With BTS game (developed by Superb Corp.) on the way.Ladies’ Code have written heartfelt letters to their fans following the news they have left their agency Polaris Entertainment.

The trio have not renewed their contracts with Polaris and are going on hiatus while the members pursue solo projects.

All the members posted their messages on social media alongside old pictures of the group

Ashley wrote on Instagram that she was ‘apologetic’ not to have promoted for their fandom, called Lavely, more often.

She posted: ‘While I feel afraid because it’s my first time starting out alone, I will make a good impression as Choi Bit Na (her Korean name) and Ashley instead of an idol, so please cheer me on a lot.

‘Thank you for the precious memories, our members and Lavely. Thank you for giving me so much undeserved love despite my many shortcomings.

‘I will be thankful if you could cheer for the new paths taken by each of the three members Lee So Jung, Kim Joo Mi, and Ashley.

‘Also, thank you to the Polaris Entertainment family for being with us all this time! I will never forget the love we received until now. Be healthy and happy. I love you.’

Sojung said in her letter: ‘Many things have happened, but I was able to hang on because of our fans who always cheered us on, cared for us, and loved us. Thank you so much.

‘I was so happy during every moment we spent together. I won’t forget.

‘Though I feel sad, I’m going to do my best to show my other sides as Lee So Jung! Please support my new beginning!’

Meanwhile rapper Zuny insisted that they are not splitting up for good.

‘We’ve gone through many things together, crying and laughing, and it’s time for us to stay apart for a while, so I’m handwriting a letter to express my heart to the members and Lavely,’ she said on Instagram.

‘It breaks my heart to think about the Lavely who will be sad to hear this news, but we are not parting—we are only staying apart temporarily to go our own ways. So please don’t be too sad, and I would like it if you could support the paths we take!!’

Polaris said in a statement released to south Korean media: ‘Before we announce the unfortunate news, we would like to express our sadness for having to say goodbye to the members who carried out their activities passionately until the end.

‘Moreover, we express our gratitude that can’t be expressed in words to the Ladies’ Code members who went through joys and sorrows as artists under our agency for seven years.

‘We send our unsparing support for Ladies’ Code’s future activities, and we will look forward to and wait for the members to promote again as Ladies’ Code.’

Ladies’ Code debuted in 2013 with five members – Ashley, Sojung, Zuny, RiSe and EunB.

However, tragedy struck in 2014 when the group were involved in a serious car accident which killed RiSe and EunB.

Ashley, Sojung and Zuny continued as a three, and had their latest comeback last year with Set Me Free.

Please allow up to 5 seconds…Birds of a feather don’t always flock together: Peer into a forest canopy, and you will likely spot multiple bird species flying and feeding together, a phenomenon most spectacular in the Amazon where 50 species may travel as a unit. But are birds in these mixed flocks cooperating with one another or competing?

In an analysis of nearly 100 North Florida flocks, Florida Museum of Natural History researchers found similar bird species were significantly more likely to flock together than hunt alone, working as a group to stay safe from predators while cruising the canopy in search of insects. Species kept competition within the flock low, however, by differentiating their foraging technique, their choice of hunting spot or the general distance they kept from a tree trunk.

In other words, think of flock dynamics like a K-pop band, said study lead author Harrison Jones.

“You have to be similar enough to the other members to get along as a group but specialized in some way: There’s the leader, the one who raps, the one who plays guitar,” said Jones, a doctoral student in the University of Florida’s department of biology. “It’s the same with birds. They hang out together because they share things in common, but they can’t share too much. If you’re so similar that you’re eating each other’s lunch, then you have a serious problem.”

North Florida’s winter flocking community is “probably the most complex in North America,” Jones said, featuring dozens of migratory species and a bevy of foraging opportunities. Still, the researchers were surprised to see how specialized the birds’ foraging habits were – a feature more reminiscent of the Amazon than North America.

The study documented previously unknown foraging behaviors in Florida, including the yellow-throated warbler’s habit of hanging sideways or upside down on palm fronds to feed on insects. Orange-crowned warblers probed the interior of dead leaves while pine warblers combed through air plants.

“These are very tropical features – not something I expected to see in a subtropical environment like Florida,” said study co-author Scott Robinson, Florida Museum Ordway Eminent Scholar and Jones’ adviser. Robinson has studied tropical bird species since 1977, with a focus on Central and South America. “Palm trees are not easy to feed from. It takes a very specialized bird using a specialized technique.”

Species that pick insects off live leaves and nab them in the air – the most common foraging techniques – were relatively abundant in mixed flocks. These included ruby-crowned kinglets, blue-gray gnatcatchers and pine warblers. But birds that hunt exclusively in harder-to-find material tended to be represented by a single member per flock. These specialists called repeatedly, as though to warn others of their kind “Hands off! This is my flock,” Jones said.

The diversity of Florida’s flocks ranged from three to 12 species and four to 36 individuals per flock. The researchers identified 14 species as regular participants in mixed flocks, with 10 species appearing in more than 80% of mixed flocks.

“We didn’t know birds were spending 80-90% of their time in these flocks,” Jones said. “It’s clear that this behavior is really important to their ecology and may explain why there’s so much partitioning of resources within the flock. They’re spending almost all their waking hours together.”

Mixed-species flocks only occur during winter, birds’ non-breeding season. Finding enough food in colder months is vital for birds, which must strike the right balance between putting on sufficient body fat to survive the night while staying lean enough to make a quick escape from a predator, Jones said.

Hunting insects as a group can be a life-saver. Flock members rely on sentinel species, which also direct the flock’s movements and pace, to sound the alarm if an owl or hawk swoops in. This allows the majority of birds in the flock to devote more attention to finding food. Traveling in numbers also lessens a bird’s chance of being the unlucky victim if a predator attacks.

In North Florida’s mixed-species flocks, tufted titmice and Carolina chickadees play the role of sentinels – “blabbermouth birds,” Jones said.

“They’re always giving little contact calls to one another as an ‘all clear,’” he said. “If they stop, everybody else is on edge. When they see a predator, they give an alarm call, and everybody in the flock will freeze.”

But these sentinel species don’t appear to be actively recruiting flock members, Jones said: “They’re just going about their business, and everyone else joins them.”

As with any good K-pop band, group choreography is key. Jones and his co-author and birding partner Mitchell Walters, also a UF doctoral student in biology, noticed mixed flocks were dominated by small, swift birds. Larger insect-eating birds, such as woodpeckers, often couldn’t keep up, joining temporarily but dropping behind when the flock moved on.

Birds that foraged in the understory, such as thrushes, didn’t flock at all.

To piece together the story of Florida’s mixed flocks, Jones and Walters, both seasoned birders, spent many hours in Gainesville’s upland hammocks, developing cricks in their necks as they stared into the canopy through their binoculars.

“By the end of the study, we started to recognize how each of these species has its own way of moving and foraging, its own personality – something birders often talk about,” Jones said. “In many ways, this study was inspired by talking to local birdwatchers and just going birding. They’ll say things like ‘Of course you only get one vireo per flock.’ And the science agreed.”

The researchers published their findings in The Auk: Ornithological Advances.2019 may have been quite a slow burn but it seems like 2020 is flying by so fast!

The group is reportedly pursuing legal action against the company, which they claim has not paid the group since their debut in 2017, despite enforcing a rigorous work schedule.

The four-piece band alleges the agency has yet to pay the group in the three years since its debut and put them on a demanding work schedule, including a 17-city U.S. tour for this year that was scheduled without their consent, despite the ongoing payment issues. The agency also allegedly failed to provide monthly revenue reports outlining revenue calculation procedures, which were promised around the time of signing their contract.

"We [The Rose] hope to terminate our contracts with the agency as soon as possible. We apologize to our fans," the group announced to media outlets.

The agency released a statement confirming it received a "certification of contents" requesting the termination of the exclusive contract due to "lack of payment, breakdown of trust, and violation of exclusive contract," Soompi reports.

"The Rose unilaterally notified [the company of] the termination of their contract, and they claimed that they will stop [attending] performances and broadcasts arranged by the company," J&Star told Star News on Friday.

The agency has refuted the latest allegations: "The Rose's claims that we 'violated terms in the exclusive contract' are entirely false," the company said in a statement.

"We have always informed The Rose of all of their promotional schedules such as overseas tours, broadcast activities, etc, well ahead of time, also coming to agreements with the members regarding each activity, not to mention preparation schedules such as practices, makeup, and such.

"We also provided The Rose with a document detailing all of the expenses and revenues from the band's full promotions since they signed the exclusive contract, and received confirmation that they saw the document," the company stated.

J&Star is reportedly planning to take counter legal measures against the band for breaches of contract and defamation of character, among other damages.

"The terms [of the contract] and content discussed in the certification of contents have no legal force. The Rose must dutifully take on their current ongoing schedule," J&Star told Star News.

Fans of The Rose have taken to social media to show their support for the band, sharing messages using the hashtag #WeStandWithTheRose, which has been trending on Twitter.

"Overworked and not being paid for 3 years they deserve so much better! Incredibly talented, kind, beautiful (inside & out) The Rose literally saved my daughter's life. I am forever grateful to them and will stand with them through this & beyond #WeStandWithTheRose," wrote @CurlygirlStacy.

"We got your back! You made the right decision and we will get through this together. #WeStandWithTheRose @TheRose_0803, wrote @SheLovesTheSea.

"Idk [I don't know] if u stan the rose or no, but right now they need our support more than ever after their company refused to pay them for the last 3 years and denied everything the members said about this situation please spread this I'm begging u #WeStandWithTheRose," wrote @KouClownsMaster.

"#WeStandWithTheRose No artists should be treated this way. They deserve much better, Please support The Rose," wrote @Pxkeona

The Rose joined the mainstream K-pop scene in 2017 with the release of their song "Sorry", which was named one of the best K-pop songs of that year by Billboard magazine. Their latest album, Red, was released last August.The Korea Times Music Festival at the Hollywood Bowl was set to feature performances by MOMOLAND, Ha Sungwoon and more in April.

Growing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus has led to the postponement of one of the biggest annual K-pop concerts in the U.S.

The Korea Times Music Festival announced that its concert scheduled for April 25 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles "has provisionally been postponed due to the increasing uncertainty threat of coronavirus." The annual musical festival, which is in its 18th year, had already announced the likes of K-pop girl group MOMOLAND, solo singer and former Wanna One member Ha Sungwoon and rock band No Brain, with the addition of more acts expected in the coming weeks.

The festival says, "Concert goers can opt for a refund or keep the existing tickets," noting that current tickets "will remain valid and transferable to the rescheduled concert date."Wheein is loved by Mamamoo fans for her goofy personality, hearty laugh and warm, hard-working personality.To write comments, please log in to one of the accounts.Nayeon is the main face of leading K-pop girl group Twice.It’s March 24, 2019, and Warsaw feels like it’s about to explode. The small Brooklyn venue, housed in a humble Polish community center, shakes with the anticipation of over 1,000 people waiting for K-pop group ATEEZ to take the stage. It’s been less than five months since the band debuted, but their popularity in the United States has already outgrown this space.

Up in the balcony, ATEEZ’s main producer Eden leans over the banister, watching as the crowd screams the Korean lyrics he wrote. At the end of the concert, ATEEZ’s leader and rapper Hongjoong points to Eden from the stage and calls him the “father” of the group’s music. The entire audience turns to look up and wave, and Eden bows gratefully. When asked about that night eight months later, Eden confesses that he is still shocked that ATEEZ has found such a loving audience in the U.S. “I thought, ‘Where did they first hear this music? How have they listened to it to a point where they’ve memorized the lyrics?’ I was very surprised,” he tells MTV News.

The 31-year-old producer sits in his studio, a plush sanctuary in the trendy Sinsa neighborhood of Seoul. The only connection to the world outside is the faint chorus of shouting and laughter floating up from the street through a cracked window.

This is where all of ATEEZ’s music is produced. When Eden and his crew moved in, they designed the space to feel like a second home. It’s padded with rugs and lit by an assortment of shaded lamps and clusters of vintage bulbs hanging overhead. A substantial crimson sectional sits across from a brick wall lined with albums bearing long, heartfelt notes from the artists with whom they collaborate. The scent of fresh flowers mixes with smoke from two cigarettes that lie extinguished in an ashtray on a coffee table. Adjacent to this common area are individual studios separated by frosted glass panel doors that are lit from within by the glow of computer screens. Before the archway a pair of plain black slippers await the return of their owner.

Eden wears a pristine black Stussy sweatshirt, vinyl sweatpants, crisp white socks, and Nikes. His dark hair frames his face; he has a habit of running his hand through it to push it up and out of his eyes, only for it to fall back down. Though his lyrics articulate a spectrum of visceral, aching emotions, Eden himself radiates meditative calm.

Not much is known about Eden outside of Korea. Even the basic details of his history as a producer and performer are diffused across the internet, some true and others false: He is a singer-songwriter under KQ Entertainment (true); he is currently the primary producer for labelmate ATEEZ’s music (true); and he once worked for CUBE Entertainment (false, he only rented a studio in the building’s basement). Eden’s compositions will soon fill arenas 15 times the size of Warsaw when ATEEZ tours again in March, and he’s ready to set the record straight. Eden prepares a cup of coffee and takes a seat on an ottoman. His hair is in his eyes again, so he pushes it away as he says, “I’ll tell you whatever you want to know.”

Eden was born in 1988 as YongHwan Kim in Yeosu, South Korea. As early as he can remember, he was playing the piano. “It's kind of a given that every Korean child learns the piano,” Eden says, but he had natural flair for the instrument that singled him out from his peers. His admiration for virtuosos like Frédéric Chopin and Sergei Rachmaninoff led him to pursue a career in music. He wanted to become a singer, and then a composer, but the only style taught in his hometown was classical, which he mastered. To study pop, he needed to go to the heart of Korea's bustling music industry: Seoul.

At 15, he moved alone to the country’s capital with the blessing and financial support of his family. "I told [my parents] I was studying in some formal setting when I was actually learning in my room by myself, using the internet." His education was simple: He bought books about programming, listened to music, and explored different genres on the piano by ear.

“I was obsessed with the idea of becoming a real musician,” he scoffs, shaking his head.

In 2010, a music file he sent to a friend reached affiliates of Source Music, and he officially debuted as half of a producing unit called Eden Beatz. His stage name references the biblical garden because he sought “to make music in the most natural, basic way." As a 22-year-old composer, he was an anomaly in South Korea; most are older, many twice his age. "That made me overconfident," he says with a chuckle.

The short-lived high was followed by years of financial and artistic struggle. Source Music was no longer able to provide the resources to continue the Eden Beatz partnership, so he joined the military to complete his two years of government-mandated service. Upon returning to Source in 2013, he found that the company was interested in taking his music down a different path than he envisioned, and they parted ways amicably. For the first time in his life, Eden had to sell his own music.

Between the ages of 25 and 29, he sold only a single song. "I was confused," he recalls, brows furrowed. "I debuted at such a young age and thought, Am I a genius?" he says. Part of the problem was that Eden didn’t want to focus on just one genre. “In the industry, my potential as a composer was perceived like this: Eden can do everything, but he’s not great at anything."

And then, KQ Entertainment reached out. Minutes into a meal of Chinese eggplant, the company’s vice director proposed they work together. “Actually the wording he used was 'I like your eyes,’” Eden says, still bemused by the turn of phrase, which was likely meant to imply that a certain “it” factor was apparent in his gaze.

But Eden wasn’t in a place to question the offer, which felt like his “last hope.” He joined KQ and lived in his studio for the next two years, producing music for his solo debut. During that time, things “radically started to change,” he says, shuffling his hands. At a party, Eden was introduced to singer-songwriter Hyun-sik Im of boy group BTOB, as well as singer and producer Seungyoun Cho, then-member of Chinese boy group UNIQ. This encounter led to the deepest friendships of his life and some of the most important collaborations of his career.

Eden, Cho, and two other producers formed a collective called Drinkcolor in 2016. He then produced two tracks for BTOB, 2016's “I’ll Be Your Man” and 2017's “Missing You,” releases that marked a “turning point” in his career. The songs were hits for the group and helped establish Eden as a versatile talent in the Korean pop industry.

In February 2017, at 29, Eden released his first single as a solo artist. “I’m Still,” a pop ballad about lost love, was well-received and the higher ups at KQ “gave a sigh of relief” that their bet on him had paid off. And then, one day, the vice director of KQ visited Eden’s studio with a bright-eyed teenager in a school uniform trailing behind him. “They told me, ‘He wants to become an idol who writes his own music,’ and asked me to teach him,” Eden says, smiling. “That was when Hongjoong entered my life.”

Hongjoong Kim was the first member of ATEEZ to join KQ as a trainee. Eden, who had no formal training, wasn’t immediately thrilled about becoming someone’s teacher. “There was a song of his that he brought to me, and I couldn't get a grasp on where to start or what to work on with him. So I thought, I'll find a way to make him give up on music,” he says, snickering at his former ruthlessness. Eden showed the teen an online encyclopedia with 200 vocabulary words related to composing. “I told him to memorize all of them by the next day. I thought he wouldn't be able to do it and that, when he came back, I’d go, 'Hey, you can't do music,' and he would quit my lessons.”

But the timid kid surprised him. “He came back with all the words memorized. He spent the whole night doing it. He hadn’t slept at all." This effort thawed Eden’s remaining resistance, and Hongjoong became his first pupil. “What I highly praise about Hongjoong is that he was below average in every discipline when he started as a trainee. He wasn’t a natural dancer, and he couldn’t rap at all. But he sacrifices rest for practice. Watching him improve, I thought, I should think of Hongjoong as my younger self and help him grow.”

Today, Hongjoong claims his own space in Eden’s cozy studio. "He knows what he needs to work on, and I give him support and direction. I don’t try to make him sound like me but, ironically, he is becoming more like me,” Eden notes. “His style of clothing, even the way he talks — he's not just copying the good things but also the things I don't like about myself.” He trails off, then says softly, “There are two people in my life that are like my sons: Hongjoong and Seungyoun Cho.” He emphasizes that they would process this information differently. "Seungyoun is a rebellious type. If you asked him, he wouldn’t really agree that he's my son. But Hongjoong embraced me. I never learned music in a formal setting from somebody else, so I didn’t want to teach anyone. But if there was one person that I had to teach music, to pass on what I know, it would be Hongjoong."

That mentorship has had a profound effect on Hongjoong, who felt that Eden respected even his earliest attempts at composing. "I was a high school student who didn’t have any significant achievement in the music industry, but he always listened to my ideas and helped me develop them," Hongjoong says. "That’s why I was able to grow and reach where I am now." Though he isn’t copying Eden’s style he admits it’s inevitable that he will “probably start resembling him,” given the amount of time they spend together.

Eden has also warmed up to the seven other members of ATEEZ. There are small moments during the group’s first reality show, a documentation of their pre-debut preparations, where his fondness for them is apparent. When the members file into a recording studio, visibly nervous while holding lyric sheets for their debut single "Pirate King" with both hands, Eden stifles an affectionate chuckle. The recording begins and every member takes a turn in the booth to receive Eden’s warm feedback.

In these interactions, he comes off like the group’s older brother. “I can’t yell at them when I’m on national TV," Eden jests. But his connection to the members is real. “I witnessed their whole journey. I was there when each of them joined the group and was a judge for their monthly evaluations. Mental resilience is a huge part of training to become an idol. Even if you've been told you’ll be a member of a group, you don't know when or if that group will debut. Everything is uncertain. I was there to give them mental support and advice, to be a mentor, to eat with them. That's how we built our relationship.”

But when recording for ATEEZ’s first album began, the relationship shifted to become more professional as pressures increased. “If I don't produce good music, the impact is greater for the eight members than it is for me,” Eden notes. In Korea, where idols are trained from a young age and forgo schooling to debut, failed careers can leave performers with limited prospects. “The possibility of ATEEZ ending up like that makes me sleepless at night. I felt that pressure like a heavy weight. So when we were working on the first album, I had very high expectations for them. During that process, a couple of the members shed some tears. I scolded them a bit.”

However, Eden never intended to have such a large role in the group’s development. “Everyone was worried when I said, ‘I will produce ATEEZ! Leave it to me!’” Eden says with a smirk. Despite his reputation as a well-rounded producer, he had become known for the signature ballad-like sound of his greatest hit to date, “Missing You.” No one at KQ was confident that he could make music for what he calls “dancing idols.” But Eden had a plan. Through network connections and word-of-mouth, he gathered a team of talented producers to help him prove his creative vision to KQ. He called them Edenary.

Edenary’s four members — Eden, Buddy, LEEZ, and Ollounder — all work in this studio. Eden rises from the ottoman and begins knocking on doors. Buddy isn’t in, but he manages to coax LEEZ and Ollounder from their rooms. “What do you have to do?” Eden asks them, as they look around shyly. “Come on, sit down.” Ollounder, who claims the pair of black slippers, runs to put on socks.

Buddy was Eden’s first recruit; the two had worked together on a project of solo collaborations called “EDEN_STARDUST.” LEEZ, who produces the brooding rock-pop of girl group Dreamcatcher, followed. Together the three of them completed all songs on ATEEZ’s first and second albums, Treasure Ep.1: All to Zero and Treasure Ep.2: Zero to One, in a span of a single, stressful month in the spring of 2018. The group's potent blend of trap, pop, and hip-hop was a hit with KQ.

For ATEEZ’s third album, Treasure Ep.3: One to All, the team realized they needed more help and pulled in Ollounder, their final member, who still works with LEEZ on Dreamcatcher’s music as part of a trio called Super Bomb. ("He's probably working on Dreamcatcher right now," Eden says, chucking a thumb towards Ollounder’s open studio door.)

Ollounder’s name is a play on the Korean pronunciation of “All Rounder,” which is apt considering that each member of Edenary was chosen for their high level of skill across multiple disciplines. “What differentiates us is that the members of other teams usually have set roles, but all four of us do everything: the tracks, lyrics and melodies," Eden explains. "It’s like having four of me.”

And their creative process doesn't leave much room for ego. They are bound by deep mutual respect and claim to have never had a disagreement. “What I’m grateful for is that they believe in me,” Eden says. Their working relationship is unusual in an industry where entertainment companies fill albums with songs cherry-picked from across dozens of different composers. By contrast, Edenary has been involved in ATEEZ’s music and identity from the beginning. That’s because the members of Edenary aren’t composers; they’re producers. Eden explains the difference: A composer is “someone who makes music and sells it to someone else," whereas a producer “sets the foundation for a group’s entire creative concept with their music, envisioning the piece’s visuals, creative, and choreography, and working with other teams to bring that vision into focus."

They’ve maintained that identity across a sizable body of work, spanning five EPs and two albums in just over a year. Using the confident "Pirate King" as their guide, the team visualizes ATEEZ’s story “like scenes from a movie,” creating music themed around exploration, teamwork, and the search for symbolic treasure. "If you think ATEEZ’s universe is like a movie, we’re probably 15 minutes in right now, in terms of the timeline,” Eden hints.

Musically, the group’s sound pulls from far-reaching influences. “K-pop as a genre is like a total art that encompasses all music. It's very flexible,” says Eden. “We want to combine many genres, instead of focusing on and identifying with a single one. If you listen to the work we’ve released so far, you can see our attempt to mix in sources and sounds from across the world — from the U.S., India, and Brazil, to various countries in Africa." LEEZ adds, “It’s a bit of rock, a bit of hip-hop, a bit of everything.”

As Eden continues to release music solo and through his ongoing collaborative series EDEN STARDUST, Edenary has begun producing other projects outside of ATEEZ. The same day that ATEEZ’s fourth Treasure series EP Action to Answer dropped, Korean artist YounHa released "Winter Flower," a collaboration with RM of BTS. Produced by Edenary, the song rocketed to the top of the charts. Later that week, ATEEZ’s Action to Answer bows at No. 5 on Billboard's World Albums chart.

"When I first met Eden, he didn’t have any hit singles," Hongjoong says. Watching his mentor work towards his current success taught Hongjoong the value of persistence and humility. “He always told me, ‘Be humble but noble,’” the rapper says, smiling. Since meeting Hongjoong, Eden’s mentorship has matured to reflect that advice. “During my 20s, I thought mentoring was about changing someone by transferring knowledge to them,” he says. “Now I focus on supporting an individual’s discovery of themselves. I see our relationship moving from a mentorship towards a friendship."The MONSTA X fandom (called Monbebe), or maybe even the majority of K-pop fandoms, often focus on how ‘cute’ their idols are, whether it be on variety shows, at the airport or on social media. MONSTA X’s first English language album All About Luv not only shakes off the ‘cute’ image but boots it up the backside off a cliff.

They sing about getting drunk and ‘swimming naked’; encourage lovers to text them behind their boyfriends’ backs, and there’s a bubbly electro track called LOVE U, the title of which should be replaced with a different four-letter word entirely.

MONSTA X has made the smart choice of appealing to a wider audience with the musical direction. The buzzy, EDM sound from their Korean albums has been traded in for club-friendly pop.

Who Do U Love, Got My Number and Beside U should get anyone on the dance floor, Monbebe or not; Happy Without Me is cheeky and radio friendly with an earworm of a chorus from Kihyun, and She’s The One brings the members back to their boy band roots as they pine over a crush.

At first fans might clutch their pearls over Misbehave – it’s a deceptively sweet tune with pretty dirty lyrics. But it fits right in with what’s in the charts and honestly it might become a new Monbebe favourite.

And it’s a strong reminder that after all, MONSTA X are men in their 20s and it’s what popstars in their 20s make songs about. This is lighter, freer music without the chaste intensity of, say, Destroyer or Dramarama, and it won’t be for everyone.

It does come at a turbulent time for the K-pop group who are two members down at the moment. Rapper Joohoney is taking time out to focus on his health and singer Wonho quit last year. However both their vocals appear on this album, and they sound great.

Joohoney’s singing has improved – those ad-libs! – although it’s a shame not to hear more of the explosive raps he’s known for; while Wonho proves he can excel when the pitch of a song suits him. I.M – the only English-speaking member – seems tamed, which is unfortunate because Monbebe know what he can do (Sambakja anyone?).

K-pop purists might have to give it a few listens, but for anyone outside the bubble who wants to dip a toe into MONSTA X’s music, All About Luv is a fun, flirty place to start.

MORE : Caroline Flack breaks social media silence despite being advised to stay offlineA former K-pop trainee has claimed that starvation was ‘normalised’ as teenage girls attempted to become idols.

K-pop groups are formed from trainees at various agencies, with young boys and girls often leaving their family homes to live in dorms with fellow trainees.

Euodias, 21, moved from her home in Britain to South Korea after landing a two-year contract with an agency following an audition.

And her family was shocked by the strict terms of her contract.

Writing for BBC News, Euodias, who is half Korean and half Chinese, explained: ‘he company could get rid of me at any time if it didn’t think I was good enough.

‘But if I chose to leave before the contract was up, I would have to repay the full cost of my training, which would run into thousands of dollars.’

At the building where she lived, parents had to get approval to visit, and were turned away if they hadn’t reached out in advance.

And when it came to the pressures of working to land a place in a group, trainees would work themselves to the bone – often rehearsing from 5am before school, until 11pm at night.

Euodias said that girls also went to extreme length to stay under the maximum weight for trainees of 47kg, writing: ‘Starving yourself was really normalised. Some trainees were anorexic or bulimic, and many of the girls didn’t have periods.

It was common to pass out from exhaustion. Often we had to help carry unconscious trainees back to the dorms.

‘If you were over the designated weight, then they would ration your food. Sometimes they would even take away entire meals and those “overweight” trainees would just be given water.’

She also claimed that trainees were banned from dating, and anyone who was openly gay was ‘ostracised’.

Euodias, who went by the stage name Dia, was offered a place in a girl group as a ‘visual’ – meaning the face of the group – with her company suggesting she have cosmetic surgery, including having her jawline shaved, to beat out competition deemed more attractive.

However, after realising she would have to act reserved, in line with the character the agency wanted for Dia, she decided to leave the agency when her contract was up for renewal.

Euodias went on to attend fashion school and now works as a YouTuber, with 345,000 followers, and has no regrets about quitting her K-pop dreams.

Years after Euodias completed her training, the South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission brought in new rules to make contracts fairer for trainees.

In 2017, the FTC enforced new rules on eight major agencies – including JYP, SM and YG – to reduce the fees demanded from teenagers after breach of contract, to stop agencies preventing former trainees from signing up to other companies and to stop agencies from cancelling contracts on morality clauses.

In recent years, agencies like Big Hit Entertainment, who look after BTS, have been praised for enforcing holidays for their artists to make sure they don’t suffer burnout.

MORE : Gordon Ramsay dresses up in drag for new TV series – and he almost looks unrecognisableLove and relationships probably are the most recurring themes for K-pop songs. But seven-piece girl band Dreamcatcher has deviated from the path by tackling a social issue. 

 For its latest release "Scream," dropped Tuesday, the septet ― Jiu, Sua, Siyeon, Handong, Yoohyeon, Dami and Gahyeon ― sings about the "witch hunt" in the Middle Ages, which is still prevailing in our society today. 

 Through the lyrics, the members indirectly blast foul-mouthed people who hurt others with their word choice. 

 "Witch hunt is linked to Dreamcatcher's musical universe," leader Jiu said in an interview with The Korea Times on Monday at a cafe in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. "Our universe centers on a magical tree that bears black fruit if we speak foul language, but grows white fruit when we use refined words. Since a witch hunt is also about hurting people with words, we thought it was connected to us."

 Interestingly, each member interpreted the lyrics in their own way. 

 "I play a victim of witch hunt for the track's first part, but as the number goes on, realize that I am actually a witch," lead vocalist Siyeon said. 

 In contrast, Sua thinks the song has two different "speakers" ― a victim and a witch. 

 "But we believe anyone could fall prey to a witch purge in their life," Jiu elaborated. "We do not want to specify who we are talking about, but want to convey a universal message that we have to bridle our tongue." 



"Scream," the lead track of the band's first studio album "Dystopia: The Tree of Language," is a blend of rock and electronic sounds. It is a powerful number with a particular emphasis on vocal. 

 The EP also contains 13 B-side songs including the speed metal-flavored "Tension," the alternative-based "Red Sun," the medium-tempo "Black or White" and the jazzy "Jazz Bar."

 "We have tracks of different genres to offer," Dami confidently said. "All of them reflect Dreamcatcher's unique music style."

 Dreamcatcher debuted in 2017 and has been noted not only for its sonic style but also for its storytelling skills. Most of the band's releases are rock-based and a part of their own fictional musical universe, which reminds people of a fantasy flick. This time, the septet unfolds a story about its "dystopia," where darkness stemming from foul language reigns. 

 "I think our combination of charismatic music and fantasy makes us offbeat," Yoohyeon said. 

 Dubbed one of the most anticipated groups of 2020, Dreamcatcher also disclosed its future goal. 

 "We want to adhere to our style and walk our own path to survive on the music scene," Sua said.Valentine's Day is upon us but there's a fine line between being romantic and inappropriate.

Online K-pop fansite Allkpop reported that the ex-girlfriend of South Korean singer Jang Moon-bok made several scandalous claims about him in a revealing tell-all post published on an online forum.

The woman, who was not identified, claimed to have dated the 24-year-old Limitless member from October 2019 till late 2019, and she said: "When I wanted to sleep, he demanded sex and asked whether or not I felt bad for his penis."

She said she met Moon-bok through mutual friends. During one meeting, while her friends had stepped away, he noticed her untied shoelaces and allegedly asked if he should "untie something else too". He put his arm around her waist while she tried to maintain her distance from him.

On subsequent outings with mutual friends, she claimed that Moon-bok demanded for kisses and sexual intercourse but she refused because they weren't dating. That led him to suggest that they should date, which they eventually did. During the course of their relationship, he "even asked for allowance once" and she gave him money, she said.

Things went south when she checked his mobile phone one day and realised that he had been in contact with other girls and giving them preferential treatment. She wrote: "He only bought me a cake after our mutual friends got him to, but he sent mobile gift cards to a bunch of other girls for their birthdays.

"He told me that he didn't invite any other girls to his Christmas concert, but I saw a lot of text messages inviting different girls. When I asked him about it, he said he had no hidden intentions and apologised, but I told him to get out of my house."

She added: "I needed a lot of courage to post this as a non-celebrity. I hope that there are no other victims like me. I have written only the truth." ​​​​​​

In response to the claims, Moon-bok allegedly went on Facebook and wrote: "We fought a lot in that short time... I think our fate ends here. I have many things that I can say but I will not say them."

According to Allkpop, his agency ONO Entertainment also released a statement admitting to Moon-bok's relationship with a "netizen A", but "they have already broken up". They added: "As this is a matter regarding the artiste's personal life, we will not be releasing any additional statements."You may have noticed many Twitter users with a superscript 7 (⁷) in their usernames multiplying at an alarming rate. Fortunately, the explanation for the sudden proliferation of the number isn't anything sinister. Like the purple heart emoji before it, the small sevens are a subtle symbol of support for Kpop group BTS.

BTS have taken over the globe, enthralling an Army of devoted fans with their catchy music, entertaining stages, and playful personalities. Now the "Boy with Luv" and "Black Swan" singers are conquering Twitter, many fans adding a small seven to their usernames to boldly declare their love for the group.

The number seven has special significance to BTS, whose upcoming album is called Map of the Soul: 7. Speaking on the Zach Sang Show earlier this year, leader RM noted that the group had seven members and has been together for seven years so far. "Also, seven means very good luck, right? Like jackpot."

The tiny sevens further help Army identify each other, which can be particularly helpful in clearing up misunderstandings caused by ardent fans using hyperbole to express their affection.

Army aren't the first Kpop fans to add tiny numbers to their Twitter usernames, following in the footsteps of NCTzens. Supporters of NCT subgroup NCT 127 have been displaying tiny 127s in their usernames since 2018, though the trend caught on with BTS fans this year.

Ordinary fans aren't the only ones getting in on it either. Both PAPER Magazine and singer Mason Ramsey have added sevens to their Twitter usernames, while DJ Swivel has gone the extra mile to add seven of them.

The Late Late Show with James Corden also temporarily sported a small seven during a BTS-themed profile makeover, and The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon used it to tease the announcement of a special BTS episode.

Due for release on Feb. 21, BTS's highly anticipated new album Map of the Soul: 7 has already been preordered over 3.42 million times. Map of the Soul: 7 isn't even out yet, but it's already making a strong bid for the title of 2020's best-selling album.

When BTS saw the breadth of their domain, they wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.Fans of K-Pop groups who want to see their idol have to wait a little longer until the coronavirus outbreak is mended

In the midst of coronavirus concern, more K-Pop events are getting cancelled day by day. A few K-pop artists are cancelling or postponing their domestic, as well as, overseas schedules for the safety of members, fans and staff members.

BTS’s agency – Big Hit Entertainment’s corporate event, which was scheduled to be held on February 4 also got cancelled. The agency announced that it will be held privately and a video will be shared on agency’s YouTube channel.

PENTAGON’s agency – CUBE Entertainment – also cancelled the showcase for the group’s latest album “UNIVERSE: THE BLACK HALL“. It is set to be held on February 12. According to the agency, the showcase will be airing real time on VLive.

After coronavirus cases were reported in the metropolitan Seoul and Gyeongi areas, “The Promise of the Day” which features EXO’s Xiumin, VIXX’s N, and SHINee’s Onew is also put off. However, performance scheduled on February 28 in Gimhae will still proceed.

In addition, other concerts in key Asian cities were also shelved. TAEYEON Concert – The UNSEEN – which was scheduled to be held in Singapore on February 1 was postponed. Likewise, NCT’s THE DREAM SHOW which was set to be held in Singapore on February 15 was also withheld.

Moreover, JYP Entertainment also decided to postpone GOT7 2020 World Tour “Keep Spinning” in Bangkok which was scheduled on February 15-16. The “Keep Spinning” Tour in Singapore scheduled on February 22 was also prorogued.

WINNER’s concert in Singapore which was scheduled for February 8 and AKMU’ concert in Changwon, Korea on February 8 and 9 were also called off.

Other overseas K-Pop events that were suspended include MOMOLAND. The group decided to delay their fan meeting tour in Japan which was scheduled for March.

LOONA and EVERGLOW also cancelled their comeback showcase, while GFRIEND decided to hold showcase without audience.Parasite is a genre-bending thriller, a social commentary that is also very funny at the same time. Winning Best Picture at this year’s Oscars shows that fans of Korean popular culture are no longer just a niche, fringe group.

This film has captured the pervading zeitgeist about the widening gulf between the extreme rich and the extreme poor in the 21st century. While it takes place in Seoul and is very Korean in its nature, it addresses a universal theme in an innovative comedy that cleverly morphs into horror.

This Academy Award win is the latest example of success and recognition for Korean popular culture, which includes not just film but K-pop music and webcomics. Parasite’s director Bong Joon Ho already has cult status for his films The Host, Snowpiercer and Okja.

Before the Oscars, Parasite won best foreign film at the BAFTAs and Palme D’Or at Cannes. K-Pop band BTS topped the ARIAS and while taking out many international awards it was snubbed at the recent Grammys.

Over the last decade, my research with K-Pop fans in Australia, Japan and most recently the Philippines shows that fans are attracted to Korean culture because they are tired of the ‘same old, same old’ self-congratulatory Hollywood output.

They consider themselves cosmopolitan consumers. They seek something different. They feel that because we live in a world that is increasingly connected, we shouldn't be looking to Hollywood or America as the only sites where popular culture can be produced, while other sites such as Seoul are beginning to emerge.

South Korean popular culture leaders have strategically positioned themselves as an alternative through innovation tied into youth culture. They are interested in pushing boundaries and responding to current global trends.

Parasite achieves all of this. It is the story of two families; one very wealthy and the other extremely poor. The narrative examines social inequality in Seoul but also globally and the increasing gap between the haves and have nots.

Through a serendipitous series of events, the poor family starts living off the rich family - even living in their home. They are the ‘parasite’. But at the same time, the wealthy family has a number of issues: their daughter is mentally unstable and they become connected to each other, eventually leading to confusion and murder.

Many fans of Korean culture are celebrating Parasite’s win as a redress and recognition that it’s become deservedly mainstream. While you might stereotypically imagine a fan of K-pop to be a screaming teenage girl, there are fan groups who are ‘mums for K-pop’ and even ‘K-pop grannies’. It’s also popular among the LGBTQI+ community.

The Academy Award accolades are not just about Korea itself but a recognition that there are different spaces outside the so-called, dominant ‘Western culture’ that allow for creative expression.

K-pop, for example, which has a highly stylised aesthetic, is an outlet for fans to channel their feelings of disillusionment and exclusion from the dominant Western culture. Now the world is catching up, these K-pop fans have an empowering sense of pride.
• Dr Tom Baudinette is a lecturer in the Department of International Studies Languages and Cultures.Over the years since their debut in 2015, the 13-member K-pop group Seventeen or SVT has grown up right before fans' eyes. They've released seven EPs, three full-length studio albums and are starting a world tour in March. Not only does the group as a whole draw you in with its smooth yet upbeat sound, they create a connection with their audience. Each member has a charisma that helps them stand out. Each performance and interview is like a constant reminder that the group just wouldn't be the same without all of them. Here are some more reasons we love them, and not just because they share our name.

Seventeen consists of three sub units

The group as a whole is made up of 13 members (not 17) and they are broken up into three sub units so that each member has an area of expertise. Each sub unit has a leader.
• S.Coups (leader of the hip-hop unit and the group as a whole)

The name Seventeen has two meanings

It's the average age of all the members of the group when they first got together and it's the sum of all the group's parts.

One group + 13 members + three sub groups = Seventeen

Their debut EP 17 Carat charted on Billboard for almost three months

It was there for 11 weeks and became the longest running album on the Billboard World Albums chart in 2015.

Two of the members are Chinese and two are American

Jun is from Shenzhen and The8 is from Liaoning, China. Vernon was born in New York and Joshua is from LA. The rest are South Korean.

The8 mentored on the second season of Idol Producer, a Chinese reality competition where contests from around the world compete to become the next pop group. The8 was a dance mentor on the show.

Fans think Vernon looks like Leonardo DiCaprio

Tons of Seventeen fans think Vernon looks like Leonardo did when they were the same age. They have even started calling him "Vercaprio." On an episode of the Korean show Happy Together, Vernon said, “If you say I resemble him, it feels good but I feel embarrassed.” What do you think?

Carat is the official name of their fan cub

The name was picked through fan votes and was announced on Valentine's Day, 2016. Their fans are the carats that help Seventeen shine. In a video with Vanity Fair, Vernon said, "Back to 2015, before our debut, we performed this song called 'Shining Diamonds.' The fan name 'carat' started off from that song... So our fans are diamonds, carats."

And they have an official lightstick

Lightsticks have become synonymous with being a true K-pop fan. Every devoted fan has a lightstick for their fav group. Seventeen's lightstick is called a "carat bong" that features its official colors. It lights up but you change those colors through an app.

They are involved in writing and producing a lot of their music

An article by MTV says that Woozi "crafted much of the group's sound since their debut." Woozi said that making the music themselves "feels more profound."

Woozi told Refinery 29, "At the end of the day, regardless of what is going on, our music is what we sing and what we show our audience. So I believe the music has to be sincere, and reveal our genuine nature. So every album of ours holds the messages and stories that we want to tell the most. And I think that is why Carats like our music."

In that same interview, Mingyu told Refinery 29, "In the end, whenever I think about the biggest influence in our lives, I go back to our parents. Our parents made it possible for us to meet and come together as Seventeen. They're the people who are closest to us, and have directly impacted our minds and thoughts.”

Seungkwan, Hoshi and DK make up the group BooSeokSoon

BBS can be considered their own sub unit within Seventeen that makes and records music separately from the rest of the group. They debuted in 2018 and released one EP so far called Just Do It. According to Billboard, the name is a reference to all the member's names and in an interview with Billboard, Joshua explained why the units are so effective. "Through our units we’re able to show off different styles of music that we weren’t able to show as a group as a whole, so that’s why I think units are really, really important to our group."

The seven-piece act debuted under the newly established Kithewhale Company in April last year with the digital single “Bloom,” but then had to take an unexpected nine-month hiatus -- quite a long time for a rookie band in the fast-changing K-pop field. Now after putting out a new single, “Cheeky,” the bandmates talked about the twists and turns in their blooming career and how they managed to keep up the momentum through teamwork. 



“After the long hiatus, it feels like we debuted again. Everything’s so new now. We feel really grateful for finally having held our first media showcase,” said band leader Laon during a recent interview with The Korea Herald. 



Enoi recently held its first press event for its first EP: “Red in the Apple,” fronted by lead track “Cheeky,” a melodic dance track that builds upon soaring vocals and a powerful rap style.







It was a do-or-die game for Laon and bandmates Dojin, Hamin, Avin, Jinwoo, J-Kid and Gun, who practiced the dance moves for “Cheeky” as many as 1,000 times. It was intense from start to finish, and several members experienced knee injuries, but the act wouldn’t change the choreography even after its agency suggested it. “We loved the original choreography, and thought it was our job not to get hurt. So instead, we came up with an alternative method that hurts our knees less,” said Laon. And it was worth the effort, as “Cheeky” has drawn accolades internationally and the video has surpassed 700,000 views on YouTube. 



When the group was on hiatus, a showcase event was delayed three times and the seven boys had ample amounts of free time. During that time, Laon recalls, there wasn’t a single moment they weren’t together.



“All of us live in the same dormitory. Although we didn’t have an official group activity, we always spent time together, literally 24/7, even when going to movies and playing games. We never let any member eat alone. It was our way of staying strong during the hiatus,” Laon said. 



J-Kid chimed in, saying, “We focused on our own self-improvement and honing teamwork during the break,” and added that they didn’t even get a chance to visit their parents as they’d promised to return home only after winning first place on a music show.



“Cheeky,” written and composed by Laon, also came to life during his daily conversation with Gun, a testament to the close bond among the band members. 



“Although we were at a standstill, nobody was lagging behind,” said Laon. 



The heartwarming story of how the boys met was more evidence of their family-like bond. Laon, who first formed the group, said he’d decided to follow his K-pop dream at a comparably late age -- and, surprisingly, out of nothing. All he had was the one-room studio he lived in -- which the group later used as its one and only studio -- and a rather “reckless” desire to form an idol group. “Everything was built from scratch. I’d once considered giving up, but I couldn’t resist my love for music that was boiling deep inside,” he said. 



So he reached out to Hamin, his close friend, and shared his plans. “I still don’t know why, but I just trusted in Laon. There wasn’t any information about the agency, nor any concrete plan, but I just gave up on other auditions and followed him,” said Hamin, the second member to join Enoi. One by one, Laon picked the rest of the members himself. Having worked in various roles ranging from manual labor and part-time costume jobs to content development, the band leader said his past experience helped him understand his bandmates. It also broadened his perspective and eventually led him to take concrete steps toward achieving something. 



“I think all of us made the ‘cheekiest’ decision from our given circumstances back then,” said Laon. To pursue their dreams, Jinwoo had to drop out of high school and Avin gave up on university. Dojin, who moved to Seoul from far away, had lived a wandering life before joining the group. Gun, who had previously moved from company to company, joined Enoi despite fears and uncertainty about a K-pop career. In J-Kid’s case, Laon bought him tteokbokki for three days in a row to persuade him to join Enoi and waited for three weeks until he made his final decision. 



“I’m so grateful for our members for trusting me -- (a person) who had absolutely nothing. Now I can’t imagine us not being together. I should be a good leader for them,” he added. 



Gun, who spent years as a trainee, also said: “Aside from singing and dancing skills, I think teamwork is the most important element for any group. If its members don’t get along well, that (can be a group’s) downfall.



“We trust and depend on each other. I can sacrifice myself for the sake of the group.” 



With teamwork at the center of their value system, the bandmates wrapped up the conversation by expressing their hopes of taking another leap and promoting the group further. They also said the next album is already in the works. 



“Promoting ‘Cheeky’ in 2020 turned out to be better for us, as we got to have a new start,” said Dojin. 



“Cheeky” was dropped Jan. 14. 



By Hong Dam-young (lotus@heraldcorp.com)Spotify, the world's largest music streaming platform, is preparing to launch its service in Korea this year, but industry officials predict that the Sweden-based service will have minimum impact in the local streaming market unless it secures licenses for Korean pop music, or 'K-pop'.

 Launched in 2008, Spotify has gained global popularity with its music-suggesting algorithm which shows new music according to users' preferences, offering a wide choice of playlists of all genres, and an attractive user interface.

 In its Feb. 5 earnings report, the streaming giant said it had 271 million active monthly users in 79 countries as of last year. 

 Though Spotify is yet to make an official announcement on advancing into South Korean market, reports say the company recently opened an office in the bustling district of Gangnam, southern Seoul, as a necessary step ahead of the official launching of its service here.

 Many music fans are excited for the local launch, as it means users will have the chance to access a slew of songs produced outside of the Korean Peninsula and not currently available on streaming services here. Some fans, who are being tired of "rampant chart manipulations" by song makers, are expecting Spotify to "cleanse the domestic music market." 

 However, officials in the music streaming industry in South Korea say that Spotify must secure the licenses of as many K-pop songs as possible to succeed here, given Korean listeners' huge preference for local, rather than Western, music.

 "When Apple made its foray into the Korean market with the streaming platform Apple Music in 2016, industry officials were fearful of being conquered by the U.S. technology heavyweight. But, after it failed to offer a large enough number of K-pop songs, Apple now has no impact on the market," an official from one of the local music streaming services said.

 "If Spotify wants to be successful here, it should analyze the music tastes of Korean listeners and make an effort to offer a customized service. Many listeners have had a long time to get used to using local platforms," the official added.

 Regarding the possibility of Spotify's entry into to the Korean market, an official at SK Telecom's FLO ― one of the sector leaders ― welcomed the plan, remarking that the advance, if it happens, could be a plus in terms of widening choices for Korean listeners. FLO's local market share was 22.2 percent in 2019, up from 14.9 percent in 2018.

 "In respect to local listeners, they will have a wider choice of streaming services (should Spotify enter the market). However, we are sure that many listeners here already have experienced FLO's quality curating service," the official said.

 According to the Korea Creative Content Agency's 2019 survey of 3,000 music listeners, 94.6 percent answered that they preferred to listen to Korean songs. This was followed by a preference for English songs at 79.2 percent; and Japanese songs at 5.3 percent. The survey showed that the ratio of Koreans preferring to listen to English songs had decreased by 7.8 percent year-on-year.

 Currently, about 10 million people in South Korea are subscribed to a paid music streaming service, with four major companies fiercely competing for their share of the world's sixth-largest music streaming market, following the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Germany and France.

 According to market research from firm Korean Click, Melon, an affiliate of internet company Kakao, has the largest share, with around 3.8 million monthly active users as of December 2019. This is followed by mobile carrier KT's Genie with 2.57 million, and FLO, serviced by SK Telecom.In exchange for their love of music, one of the rights that K-Pop idols has to probably give up first is dating.

Many record companies in South Korea are known to manage their new recruits and include a “no dating” clause in contracts. Dating still happens though so, what’s the secret?

Well, some turn to social media, and others may likely to utilize online dating sites, which are becoming more popular, as explained by experts on this site: “Online dating platforms can be better environments for finding love as they give you useful information on who is available and likely to be compatible with us.”

Nevertheless, things aren’t that simple for K-pop stars, and that’s for so many reasons, with a few covered here.

Dating is a Taboo in the K-Pop World

K-Pop stars are secreted away not like in the west where the romantic lives of celebrities are deliberately public as part of marketing and promo campaigns.

When musicians Hyuna and E-Dawn were disclosed to be dating, there was a furious reaction from broken-hearted supporters and the couple was promptly ousted by their record label, Cube Entertainment, under which they had performed with each other as part of the Triple H outfit.

In this instance, dating was a breach of contract, but the reaction from the fans is easily argued as unreasonable. Everyone is entitled to a private life. Period.

The K-Pop industry is huge with bands not only endorsing premium products but also becoming big brand names in their own right.

Controversies surrounding drinking, drugs or even dating, not only rock the boat in the celebrity gossip but also the financial news since so many of Korea’s largest music management firms are publicly traded stocks on the Korean stock exchange.

A bad news day of K-Pop headline can deliver a massive punch to the bottom line. This was exactly the case for Cube, who saw share prices drop dramatically on the rear of headlines that made news in South Korea and all over the world.

It is very strict in the K-Pop world. As the managing companies handle artists, they make them a top priority but expect trust. If trust is broken, there will surely be consequences. As things stand now, with the perils of openly dating, stars at least have some small respite.

According to analysts, much of the dating outcry is embedded in the features of the K-Pop sensation.

The K-Pop industry has developed extremely devoted fan bases. Fans with enough time and money may get to see a beloved idol every day of the week. Fan groups take on the responsibility of promoting their favorite group and for keeping their image squeaky clean.

Some fan clubs go one step further and make charitable contributions on behalf of their favorite musicians, or they bear the costs of promotional advertising to promote concerts and new releases. Since fans put so much effort into encouraging and publicizing, some may fall under the impression they are entitled to influence the personal life of their idol.

For the K-Pop stars, this intense fan loyalty and its associated fan fear quickly become restrictive and demoralizing especially when they want to do the routine and normal like other young people, such as go out on a date.

Yet, intense loyalty gives rise to some fairly extreme reactions. During Girls’ Generation’s 2008 performance at a big annual K-Pop show in Seoul, the audience created a “black ocean”. They refused to wave lights on their cell phones, and instead remained silent throughout the band’s entire 10-minute performance to protest how close the band had become to the members of Super Junior.

While the K-Pop sector is changing and its limits are expanding, the genre remains fixed firmly hand in hand with intensely managed and deeply produced groups.

Stars sign with labels in late adolescence and live alongside other artists under the supervision of the record company. They are expected to participate in intensive training, rehearsals and promotional schemes as well as endure a performance schedule that has left young superstars burned out and exhausted.

Even for the artists who are with companies that allow dating, fan blowback may leave them unable to enjoy much of a life of love.

Regardless of the privacy breaches that using social media platforms can pose, it’s worth considering whether K-Pop could have happened without social media, especially when the big networking sites aren’t as prominent in Korean popular culture.

In reality, Korean users use Korean social networking channels although they still manage a global reach. K-Pop prowess can still be acknowledged by the influence of social media, and are not afraid to ride its waves to better present and to continue publicize the phenomenon worldwide.ACE’s agency plans to take legal action for malicious comments and rumours targeted towards its band and their recent vehicle attack of what is described as a ‘super glue terror incident’.

Last Wednesday, Beat Interactive publicly announced in a statement their intention of moving forward with a legal proceeding and detailed the terrifying incident that was believed to have occurred on February 18 near the K-Pop group’s practice room.

The five-member boy band’s vehicle was revealed to have been tampered with by the application of glue to specific parts to cause harm to the members and damage property with the intent of knowing ACE’s route and transportation time frame in advance, the Korean label shared.

Beat Interactive went on to share that the incident is under police investigation and the person in question will be strictly punished without leniency.

The members Wow, Donghun, Kim Byeongkwan, Jun and Chan are feeling mental uneasiness and are experiencing fear that the similar or identical situation will occur in the near future.

The label’s CEO Kim Hye Im concluded in the statement that ACE’s mental health has been significantly affected after recently discovering explicit personal attacks, false rumours, and malicious defamatory statements online and on social media.

Due to the members’ weakened mental and physical conditions, their scheduled activities will be adjusted and they will receive psychiatric counselling as per their request.

Last week, the K-Pop group performed at the four-time Academy Award-winning Korean movie Parasite’s Oscar 2020 after-party in Los Angeles, where they sang their own songs and renditions of K-Pop songs from acts like BTS and HOT.

ACE — an acronym for Adventure Calling Emotions — were formally introduced in 2017 with track ‘Cactus’ and have released a total of three EPs: ‘ACE Adventures in Wonderland’, ‘Under Cover’, and ‘Under Cover: The Mad Squad’.A whole lot of things went down at Oscars 2020, but one of the biggest surprises of the night came from five-member Korean group A.C.E. after the ceremony was long over.

To celebrate Parasite’s historic win, A.C.E performed at one of the film’s after-parties and surprised attendees with their very own rendition of the some of Korea’s most beloved songs, which, of course, included some BTS.

During the celebration, A.C.E took the stage at Los Angeles’s Soho House with covers of BTS’s hit songs “Fake Love” and “DNA.” The quintet honored Bangtan with explosive choreography and live vocals, which the guests seemed to love. Apart from their BTS covers, the group also took on H.O.T.'s 1998 track "Hope" as well as their own original songs.

After seeing A.C.E’s performances, both the originals and covers, many fans took to Twitter to show their support for the group. “So a.c.e performed at the after party of the first foreign language film to win best picture, a movie which one of their company’s editors worked on, did their own songs, covered a bts song, and yuchan and byeongkwan wore crop tops. like it really does not get better than this,” a fan commented. “A.C.E COVERING BTS'S "FAKE LOVE" AT THE OSCAR'S AFTERPARTY HELLOOOOOO YES THIS IS AMAZING,” another added.

A.C.E — made up of members Donghun, Wow, Jun, Kim Byeongkwan, and Chan — debuted in 2017 with the track “Cactus.” The group’s name is an acronym for “Adventure Calling Emotions.”

Since their debut, A.C.E has put out three EPs: A.C.E Adventures in Wonderland, Under Cover, and Under Cover: The Mad Squad, which came out this past October. Even before their official debut, the quintet became known for their covers of other artists — including BTS, BLACKPINK, and John Legend — and last night only continued their trajectory of success.

While Korean music has spent the past decade working its way to becoming part of the mainstream-music conversation—and now represents the sixth-largest music industry in the world behind France, Germany, the U.K., Japan, and the United States—the chatter is mainly around pretty, pop-focused boy bands and girl groups such as BTS, BLACKPINK, NCT and TWICE who dominate YouTube and social media. Despite its heavy focus on K-pop, Korea has found a handful of artists in its burgeoning subgenres able to create both the excitement and fandom comparable to its super-pop stars.

Cue DAY6. In their four years together, the five-member rock outfit have managed to rise to the top of the charts around the world and have done so in a way that puts artistry first and captures the same enthusiasm that follows some of the world’s biggest boy and rock bands.

To put it simply, and by using their own words, DAY6 are, in fact, having the “Time Of Our Life” amid the “Sweet Chaos” that comes as the Korean band have more or less been given the reins when it comes to what they put out under their name. Yet, despite the promising results as they edge toward their five-year anniversary in 2020, the question of how to remain on their trajectory while simultaneously being true to themselves comes up often.

“Our goal has always been just one thing: It was [to] do music that we liked, that we’re satisfied with, and we hope that other people will be satisfied with it,” guitarist Jae Park shares. “It’s largely always just been us pursuing our interests and curiosity with music. So, even if we do become this crazy, world-famous [band], like, everybody knows DAY6, I think our goals will still stay the same.”

The topic of authenticity in music is one that’s always heavily debated in the pop scene and has been a critical point of many pop acts from Korea who are frequently tagged as “manufactured” for mass consumption until the next fresher, younger act come to replace them.

“That is something that we, as a group, have actually been discussing lately within ourselves: ‘How do we remain authentic?’” Jae reveals. “How do we not segue toward the music that we know is going to do better on the charts, but that we don’t like?”

Putting the question of authenticity up to DAY6 gives a spectrum of answers. Sungjin says self-acceptance, and Dowoon uses rational thinking as their personal keys to be authentic. Meanwhile, Wonpil says his role as a performer in the band is his most genuine expression: “The moment when we perform and sing our songs is when I am the most sincere and honest to myself.”

“We feel that we remained honest so far, so we’re just trying to maintain that honesty and keep pursuing music for what it is,” Jae concludes.

Young K agrees with his bandmates but offers the question, “What is good music? We don’t know. Whatever we wanted to do at that moment? And we’re probably going to do that with the next album and the one after and so on. We don’t even know which kind of songs are going to do well on the charts,” he says, before adding with a laugh, “and if we knew, we would have done better! So, we’re just going to do whatever we want.”

South Korea's Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency sent a sample of Kim's body hair to the country's National Forensic Service for examination and no illegal drugs were detected, police confirmed to the Sports World news outlet, Soompi reports.

"It is true that the drug test result is negative," police said in a statement to Sports World, Hellokpop reports.

The latest examination was done in addition to a 14-hour investigation Kim underwent last year in September. It marks the conclusion of the investigation but a final verdict from the prosecution has yet to be announced, Hellokpop reports.

The South Korean rapper, also known as B.I, announced his departure back in June following allegations that he purchased marijuana and LSD in 2016, as reported by Korean tabloid magazine Dispatch. The purchase and use of illegal drugs is an offense in South Korea that can carry a sentence of up to around five years in prison.

Kim apologized for his actions in a post on his Instagram account and explained why he was leaving the group.

"First, I would like to sincerely apologize for stirring up trouble due to my tremendously inappropriate actions. It is true that I wanted to rely on something that I shouldn't have had any interest in due to going through a hard and painful time. However, I was too scared and fearful to do it," he said.

"Even so, I am so ashamed and apologetic to fans who were greatly disappointed and hurt because of my wrong words and actions. I intend to humbly self-reflect on my mistake and leave the team. Once again, I bow my head down and sincerely apologize to fans and the members. I apologize," he added.

Fans of B.I have been taken to social media to show their support for the artist and celebrate his negative drug test results using the hashtag #HelloHanbinIsFree, which has been trending on Twittter, along with other related terms and hashtags.

"Hanbin you are worth the fight. Fighting with you in this battle is very tiring and hard, but you are my motivation. Remember when I said we are fighting for victory? This is it. The victory has won now. #HelloHanbinIsFree" @chaggiexx.

"Listen: hanbin has been proven innocent. meaning he didnt do anything wrong. meaning those stories were lies. meaning he didnt deserve any of the slander. so if I see a single one of yall trying to say anything REMOTELY bad about him, i'll come for your knees #HelloHanbinIsFree," wrote @ktaejavu.

"It's been almost 9 months but it was worth the wait. now it's your time to shine even brighter and show who's the boss here. #HelloHanbinIsFree" wrote @chrryhanbin.

"There is no need to defend yourself when mistreated by others, because time will direct the truth and the goodness that will protect the sincere soul. And i learn it from you Hanbin-ah. You have a pure heart. Your kindness make me fall in love many times #HelloHanbinIsFree," @LittleChick8_

Last June, Yang Hyun-suk, the former chief executive officer and chief producer at YG Entertainment (Kim's former management company), resigned after being accused of attempting to cover up drug charges around Kim, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.

YG Entertainment has been involved in a series of scandals in recent months. Back in February last year, Seungri (former member of K-pop group BIGBANG) was accused of arranging sexual services for rich clients at a nightclub he owns.

Earlier this month, iKon released their new album i DECIDE.A British-born K-pop star who moved to Seoul as a child to train to join a girl group has revealed the grueling reality of no days off, strict monitoring and sleeping on the floor in cramped dorm rooms.

Euodias, 21, from Sunderland, spent two years living in a trainee house while she pursued her dream of stardom in South Korea.

She told the BBC that girls would regularly starve themselves and pass out during rehearsals due to exhaustion, while the company 'encouraged' them to have plastic surgery to look more like a popstar.

There were also 'uncles' who closely monitored the girls' behaviour to ensure they didn't miss strict curfews.

Despite being placed in a girl group, Euodias ended up walking away from her dream at the end of her contract before the band launched, and returned to the UK.

The 21-year-old now works as a YouTuber and has over 38,000 followers on Instagram.

Euodias, who is of Chinese and Korean heritage, grew up watching South Korean TV dramas and dreamed of being a star.

When she was 10 she started sending videos to companies and ended up getting an audition alongside 2,000 others while on holiday in Seoul.

Within days she was asked to return with a parent to discuss a contract, which outlined how she would leave her family and move to South Korea in order to live and train with the company.

It stated that if she left before the end of her contract, her family would have to repay the full cost of her training, which could run up to thousands of pounds.

Her mother signed the shortest contract available, two years, and Euodias moved into the building with the other trainees, who were all between the ages of nine and 16.

Relatives could visit, but only if they had approved permission from the company in advance, and she was only allowed to use her phone for 15 minutes at night.

Training was rigorous, starting with pre-school dance practice at 5am, with many trainees staying up till 11pm for late-night dance sessions in order to impress their instructors.

And the group had a strict curfew to ensure they were back in the dorms before the staff locked the building for the night. Many girls had an 'uncle' who would text to ensure they were in their rooms.

Euodias said there were 'no such thing as weekend or holidays' for the group.

In January, K-pop stars began speaking out about how they are expected to be perfect as they lifted the lid on the cutthroat industry in the wake of a string of suicides from high-profile stars. The culture of K-pop is one of South Korea's most lucrative soft power exports and has drawn a massive audience of young people internationally. But the suicide deaths of two popular female stars less than two months apart drew attention to the industry's darker side and the intense pressures that artists face. K-pop star Sulli, whose given name is Choi Jin-ri, took her own life in October. Her friend and fellow star, Koo Hara, killed herself a month later. Both stars had been victims of severe bullying on social media. In an interview with CBS in January, K-pop artist Amber Liu said there was an industry expectation to be perfect in looks, performance and discipline. 'If you aren't under a certain weight, you can definitely get cut,' Liu said. 'You're told what to do, what to say, what to think.' Liu, who was Sulli's former bandmate, said she has witnessed firsthand the toll the industry, as well as cyberbullying, can have on its stars. 'When (people) hear you're getting help they're like, 'What? Why are you getting help? That's weird',' she said. 'That stigma against mental health is just so strong.' K-pop stars, who are often referred to as 'idols', usually have an average retirement age of about 30. In some extreme cases, stars can undergo training for 10 years before they can make their debut in the industry. Many stars face tremendous pressure to look and behave perfectly in an industry powered by so-called 'fandoms' - groups of well-organised admirers who spend enormous amounts of time and money to help their favored stars climb up the charts and attack their perceived rivals. In return, the stars are expected to tread carefully in an industry where today's most-fervent fans can be tomorrow's most vicious critics if their idols fail to meet their expectations - or 'betray' them. Drug use or drunken driving are seen as career-breakers, while behavior that causes a 'stir' - anything from a social media gaffe to a failure to smile ceaselessly at public appearances - could be criticized for years. Many are constantly chased by paparazzi and camera-touting fans who share or sell every single detail and images of the stars' daily lives online for public scrutiny.

Within the building, trainees did not use their own name, but instead instructors gave them each a number.

Euodias was a favourite of the company because of her petite size, with instructors regularly praising her for her tiny frame.

She said: 'Weight was the constant obsession of everyone there. Everyone was required to be no heavier than 47kg (7st 6lb or 104lb) regardless of their age or height.'

During weekly weigh-ins, each trainee's body would be analysed before their weight was announced to the room.

If anybody was over the 47kg (7st 6lb) weight, food would be rationed or taken away completely.

As a result, Euodias revealed: 'Starving yourself was really normalised. Some trainees were anorexic or bulimic, and many of the girls didn't have periods.'

She said it was also 'common' to pass out from exhaustion, and the group would often find themselves carrying an unconscious trainees back to the dorms.

She passed out twice during dance practice, waking up in bed not knowing how I got there.

Euodias was delighted when she was asked to join a K-pop group, but was also told that another girl was competing against her for the spot of 'visual'.

The visual is the face of the group, with the selected girl chosen for her appearance, and how she might look in the future.

While Euodias felt her competition was prettier than her, the company encouraged her to get plastic surgery because they said it would make her more attractive.

Trainers encouraged her to change the bridge of her nose and shave her jawline.

Later, after learning she had beaten out the competition for the spot as visual, Euodias learned more about the group and started to feel 'iffy'.

She was told the character behind her stage name Dia was 'very reserved, sweet and innocent.'

However she ultimately decided to leave at the end of her two-year contract. Euodias returned to England and was reunited with her family and friends, going on to do an art foundation course before going to fashion school in Paris.FILE - In this March 14, 2019, file photo, Seungri, center, member of a popular K-pop boy band Big Bang, arrives at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in Seoul, South Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A K-pop star charged with violating South Korea’s anti-prostitution law may have to join the country’s army and face trial in a military court.

Last week, prosecutors indicted former Big Bang member Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, on charges of violating laws on prostitution, illegal gambling and foreign currency trading.

The state-run Military Manpower Administration said Tuesday it sent Seungri documents asking him to report for 21 months of mandatory military service, a requirement for all able-bodied men in South Korea, because prosecutors had ended their investigation of him.

It said in a statement that it was concerned a protracted trial in civilian courts would hamper its effort to equally apply the military obligation on Seungri, 29.

It said Seungri’s case will be handed over to a military court if he joins the military.

Men eligible for military service in South Korea are allowed to delay their conscription five times under certain conditions before they become 31, but the accumulated delayed time cannot exceed two years.

Seungri postponed his conscription in March 2019. The draft agency said it won’t disclose whether he delayed his conscription again, or when he is expected to join the military, citing privacy regulations.

South Korean media said Seungri is expected to enter the military in late February or early March. Yonhap news agency said it’s unlikely that the draft agency will accept another request by him to postpone his conscription over future trials in civilian courts.

Prosecutors gave no details about the charges. South Korean media reported that Seungri was accused of buying prostitutes for himself and business investors from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong, engaging in illegal gambling overseas, and failing to report to South Korean authorities about money he borrowed abroad to use in gambling. Seungri has previously denied most of the allegations.

Big Bang has been one of the most successful K-pop bands since its debut in 2006, attracting huge, loyal followings in Asia and around the world. Forbes magazine reported in 2016 that it took home $44 million in pretax earnings the previous year. Big Bang has been on a temporary hiatus as other members served in the military.

Seungri’s case is one of several scandals that have roiled South Korea’s entertainment industry in recent years. In November, singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young received a six-year prison term, and former boy band member Choi Jong-hoon a five-year term, after they were found guilty of illicit sexual relations with a woman who was unable to resist.Super Sunday: a day when charismatic young men at their physical peak, specialists in their craft, make fans go wild.

I’m talking, of course, about the K-pop group SuperM, which packed the SAP Center in San Jose on Sunday, Feb. 2.

SuperM, the supergroup that has been compared to Marvel’s Avengers, consists of Taemin, Baekhyun, Kai, Taeyong, Mark, Lucas and Ten — and they are each certified aces of their respective K-pop groups (Shinee, EXO, NCT 127, and WayV). The supergroup concept has been done before in K-pop, but this one feels different. By plucking the top talents from SM Entertainment, one of South Korea’s dominant music companies, SuperM feels more like a sleek Lamborghini than a tricked-out import.

The crowd, mostly young and female, was definitely up for it after waiting in long lines outside SAP Center. By the time the group hit the stage to “I Can’t Stand the Rain” at 7:20 p.m., the Shark Tank was filled with screaming, light-stick-clutching fans who helped set the scene, as if the arena was taken over by multicolored fireflies.

With the group already at headliner status with just six songs to its name (not counting two instrumentals), the big question was how SuperM was going to execute an arena-quality show with limited material.

One by one, they gave insights into each of their artistic specialties and personalities. Ten, Taemin and Kai’s kinetic dance moves during their individual turns were breathtaking and indicative of the vital role choreography plays in K-pop. Baekhyun gave off heavy R&B vibes during “Betcha” and “UN Village.” Lucas showed himself to be the most playful member during his “Bass Go Boom” spotlight, while “GTA” and “Talk About” revealed Taeyong and Mark as the resident hip-hop heads, stalking the stage and spitting bars like rap heroes.

They also added unreleased songs and a tasty cover of NCT U’s “Baby Don’t Stop,” making the concert feel like an exclusive listening party. When they all assembled for “No Manners,” “2 Fast,” “Super Car” and the unreleased trap-pop track “Dangerous Woman,” the energy in the arena spiked, demonstrating that SuperM is more than just the sum of its ridiculously good-looking parts.

“I’ll be honest, I was a little tired. But when I saw you, my energy is 100% filled,” Baekhyun said, through an interpreter. “You guys are like my Red Bulls.”

During the highlight reel that played between the main set and the three-song closer, the words “SuperM is forever” echoed around the arena. It was tantalizing confirmation that the group is not just a one-off and will continue to record and tour in the future.

And when they performed their gargantuan single “Jopping,” that really sent the crowd buzzing home on an otherwise depressing day for the Bay Area’s Niner Gang. Parents who gave up their Super Bowl Sunday to chaperone their kids to a SuperM concert made a wise choice. It was the ultimate audible.K-pop singer Lee Jae-hoon from Cool said he married in 2009 and has two children, two days after actor Sung Joon revealed his December 2018 marriageCoca-Cola Arena has officially confirmed in a tweet that the South Korean music show Music Bank will be bringing its world tour live on March 21.

As Gulf News tabloid first revealed earlier this month, the ‘Music Bank in Dubai’ stage is set to dazzle with performances by popular and well-established K-Pop acts Twice, Seventeen, Monsta X, Jus2 as well as Exo’s Baekhyun.

The big news earlier Friday morning prompted fans to tweet their excitement and thrill of having another K-Pop concert the same weekend. On March 20, the arena will be also be taken over by ‘K-Pop Super Concert’, with veteran K-Pop group Super Junior as the headliners along with anticipated performances from groups NCT 127 and Laboum, reggae duo RGP and soloist Jun.

The confirmed KBS Music Bank stellar-studded line-up list unquestionably have a massive fan following in the UAE. Music from the popular acts has been seen taking over the local iTunes chart with new releases.

While Twice and GOT7’s unit group Jus2 will stage their debut performance at the multi-purpose indoor arena, it isn’t the first for Exo member Baekhyun and Seventeen in the UAE.

Baekhyun previously performed at 2018’s ‘SMTown Live World Tour VI in Dubai’ and flew to Dubai to film project group SuperM’s debut music video last year.

As for Seventeen, the K-Pop sensation held a mini-concert alongside other Korean acts at the Dubai World Trade Centre for the Korea Brand & Content Expo 2019 event last October, while Monsta X performed at KCON 2016 Abu Dhabi.

All-male group Monsta X performed at the MDL Beast Festival in Riyadh in December of last year.

Dubai is one of many long lists of city stops as part of KBS Music Bank’s annual concert world tour. The South Korean TV show has hosted its concert series in cities such as Japan, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Turkey and Brazil since 2001. The emirate will reportedly become it’s 15th world tour location.

The latest announcement comes after Korean broadcasting companies and music labels have halted or suspended K-Pop events and concerts amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak and the safety of fans and its artists.

More details on the duration and tickets are yet to be revealed.K-pop boy band X1 split up after producers of South Korean reality show Produce X 101 were accused of manipulating the votes that chose the final band members. Photo: HandoutThanks to their intensive choreographies, K-pop stages are notoriously entertaining to watch. But being a good performer is about more than just dancing or singing well, and the most captivating performers to watch are the ones who can engage in a kind of storytelling through their facial expressions. These talented idols bring a range of emotion and charisma to every single moment of their performances, even when they’re in the background. They can switch from stone-cold sexy to playful to cute in the blink of an eye, and can even make you notice parts of your favorite hits in a new light, or leave you with fresh interpretations of songs. It takes incredible talent and versatility to be able to perform at such a high level, but these 14 idols consistently take our breath away with their facial expressions!

First up, if there’s anyone who was born for the stage, it’s BIGBANG leader G-Dragon. While best known for his sexy and edgy image and killer, fierce expressions to match, the king of K-pop can easily switch things up to do quirkier concepts or show his softer side, like in BIGBANG’s laidback “We Like To Party”:

Sunmi is the queen of duality, going from sugary sweet in one moment to dead sexy in the next. Her facial expressions are essential to the point dances of her famous choreographies, and her expressive performances are part of why she has quickly become royalty in the K-pop world!

Kino went viral for being adorably enthusiastic in this 2018 performance of PENTAGON’s hit “Shine,” and it’s easy to see why: he’s a natural on stage, and he effortlessly uses his facial expressions to embody cute concepts just as easily as sexy ones, like the group’s latest, edgier release “Dr. BeBe.”

Known for having one of the most expressive faces in K-pop, V performs at 100 percent the entire time he’s on stage. His expressions range from sultry to flirty to downright dorky and hilarious, sometimes all in the same performance! Watch him in action in “21st Century Girls”:

Hyolyn is not only a vocal queen but also a performance rockstar. This K-pop diva is best known for her sexy and flirty concepts, and she has mastered the art of the smize. Underrated, however, are her more serious sides — as this one-take video for “You Know Better” attests to. Hyolyn gorgeously expresses her deepest, rawest emotions not only with her vocals but also with her face!

You would never know that ATEEZ is still a rookie group, considering what talented performers they are, and this is especially true of their leader. Hongjoong manages to bring nuance and levity to even ATEEZ’s heaviest songs with his facial expressions, and on their more playful songs, well, you’ll have to see for yourself:

HyunA is best known for her onstage sexiness, and she’s also the reigning K-pop stank eye champion. Both as a former 4Minute member and as a solo artist, HyunA has brought savage concepts to a whole new level with her fierce facials — but she’s also delved into softer concepts in recent years, and can bring just as much subtle flirtation as she can sexiness!

Hyunjin’s expressions tend towards the flirty side, but we’re just amazed that he manages to emote so engagingly while nailing Stray Kids’s tough choreographies. He’s either intensely absorbed in their more serious tracks, or genuinely looks like he’s having a ton of fun the entire time he’s on stage, like in the performance of “My Pace” below — and it’s hard not to smile when watching that!

JooE is well-loved for her infectious smile and boundless energy, which sometimes makes it hard to even see her face on stage since she’s moving so fast! But her expressiveness brings extra fun to all of MOMOLAND’s performances, and her enthusiasm is bound to bring a smile to your face too, like in this viral fancam:

Despite the fact that ONEUS just debuted in 2019, Hwanwoong has the flair of someone who’s been performing for years, and his expressive face brings any song to life. The playfulness of their recent track “LIT” really allowed him to shine, and we love the song even more after watching his quirky take on it!

Soyeon has a ton of stage presence, and her expressions are a huge part of that. She’s known for her fierce rapper image, but this boss leader mixes it up with flirty and cute expressions to match the vibe of any song — and she always brings her A-game.

Yeonjun’s expression changes are as fast and sharp as his dance moves, which is saying quite a lot. His mischievous smile adds the perfect touch to many of TXT’s songs, and he never fails to tell a story and convey the group’s signature youthful energy through his face.

All of the MAMAMOO members are exceptionally strong performers, so it’s no surprise that their leader constantly uses her facial expressions to take their stages to the next level. Solar is always giving us an array of coy smirks, winks, or flashes of her gorgeous smile. We would expect nothing less from this group of self-confident ladies!

Kai might just be the king of stage presence, and this is mainly because his facial expressions are pure perfection: they draw you in and somehow manage to give you a whole new appreciation for EXO’s tracks. His intensity in EXO’s sexier songs is unmatched, but his flirtation and looks of pure joy in songs like “Love Me Right” show Kai’s incredible versatility:

Hey Soompiers, which of these idols captivated you the most? Which other idols have on-stage facial expressions that you can’t get enough of? Let us know in the comments!

hgordon stays up way too late on weeknights marathoning K-dramas and trying to keep up with the latest K-pop releases. Follow her adventures in Seoul on Instagram.Prominent figures from K-pop agencies have been working with girl groups managed by other companies.

Lee Soo-man, founder and chief producer of S.M. Entertainment, participated in the production of girl group LOONA’s second EP, “#,” released Feb. 5. The 12-piece act, whose Korean name translates to “Girl of the Month”, is managed by Blockberry Creative, a small entertainment agency.

The EP has topped the iTunes Albums chart in 47 countries including Poland, Spain, Thailand and Denmark.

It was the first time Lee, head of S.M. Entertainment, had produced for a K-pop act unaffiliated with his agency, a major entertainment company here.

“Producer Lee gets a lot of proposals from different countries as well, and he seems to have considered the opportunity a good chance to expand his role as a producer, although LOONA is not from S.M. Entertainment,” an official from S.M. Entertainment told The Korea Herald.

Lee became aware of LOONA after the group dance-covered “Cherry Bomb”, a song from S.M. Entertainment’s boy band NCT 127, the official added. The dance cover video attracted nearly a million views on YouTube.

Another girl group, GFriend, came into the spotlight after Big Hit Entertainment, the music label of BTS, acquired the band’s agency Source Music last year.

On Feb. 3, the act released Labyrinth, the first album since the acquisition. Bang Si-hyuk, the founder of Big Hit Entertainment, wrote two songs for the album. Key producers of the company also took part in its production.

GFriend’s videos were uploaded to the official video channel of Big Hit Labels, and the music video for its track “Crossroads” hit nearly 20 million views.This website uses cookies and other technology to enhance quality of service.

The group’s agency, Pledis Entertainment, announced the cancelation on Twitter on Sunday.

“Due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, we have decided to cancel Seventeen’s February and March world tour in consideration of the health and safety of both artists and fans.”

The canceled shows were scheduled to take place in Kuala Lumpur, Taipei, Madrid, Paris, London and Berlin.

Pledis Entertainment also announced that fans were advised to “refer to the concert organizer’s social media for further ticket refund information”.

Seventeen’s tour is the latest to be called off by Asian performers, including K-pop stars Taeyeon, Winner and NCT in Singapore and Macau.

As of Sunday, the death toll of the 2019 novel coronavirus has surged past 800 in mainland China, overtaking global fatalities in the 2002/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. (wng)Everyone has certainly heard at least one K-pop song in their life. May it be "Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry" or "E-e-e-e-e-e-e," this catchy genre has been a mainstay in the Philippine music scene for years—way back when we used to burn CDs with our idols' songs and Instagram wasn't even a thing yet.

It's evident that until now, K-pop remains to be on top. New, amazing groups have risen (and we certainly have stanned so hard), but we all know that the second-generation K-pop idols will always have a special place in our hearts. The mid-2000s marked as one of the best years in the Hallyu wave, where artists dominated charts and helped pave the way for K-pop to be known for what it is today. We know you're also missing our beloved idols (especially if you're part of the #TitasOfKpop) as much as we do, so here's an update on what they're up to now:

Best known for that bold and mature concepts and for starting a trend with their hip dance in "Abracadabra" (which was also seen in Psy's "Gentleman"), the Brown Eyed Girls stand strong and have been active as a group even after 16 years. They had their much-anticipated comeback last year with a remake album RE_vive.



Debuting in 2007, Girls' Generation (or SNSD) is probably the biggest girl group not just in South Korea but also around the world. They successfully entered the Japanese music scene and became an influence on rising K-pop groups and other artists. While most of the members have gone solo, they reunited last year for Tiffany's birthday and assured SONEs that they still have each other's back.

The retro queens reached international fame especially in the US when they collaborated with various icons, performing their hit, "Nobody." This wonder of a K-pop girl group celebrated its 12th anniversary last year despite disbanding in 2017.



This group shied away from bubblegum and sexy concepts and brought their A-game to a whole new level with their edgy vibe and aesthetic. Recognized for their epic stage performances, the queens may have parted ways but always remained in touch. In fact, they celebrated their anniversary last year with a cake and went live on IG.

f(x) showed how they're not your average group because of their quirky and cool concepts. In 2019, everyone was saddened when Sulli passed away, with the members showing their grief and sharing their fond memories with her. Today, they continue on with their solo careers in acting, vlogging, and singing.

The sexy and fierce group was a hot issue in the Hallyu world (IYKWIM) and released powerful songs that empowered women. The group decided not to renew their contract in 2016, disbanded, and signed with their respective agencies as actresses and solo performers. A small party was held last year in time for their 10th anniversary, which warmed every 4Nias' heart.

With striking visuals and equally striking talents, After School proved to be a game-changer especially with their choreography (poll dancing, anyone?). Their unwavering persistence and hard work sparkled all throughout their career. There was no formal disbandment for this group, but we're happy to see them reuniting in 2017 for Nana's birthday.



This Korean-Chinese quartet introduced us to bold, feisty songs and dance steps with their single "Bad Girl Good Girl", which is being constantly covered by new K-pop idols in stage performances. Member Fei included this song, along with other hits, in a dance medley she uploaded on YouTube last year.

With sensual yet LSS-inducing tracks, everyone was head over heels with Sistar. Despite having disbanded in 2017, the group still shows Star1s that they still hang out together, like when they posted their photos on their IG for Hyolyn and Bora's birthdays.

Known for their captivating songs "Bo Peep" and "Roly Poly", T-Ara was immensely popular in China and even performed in private events in the country. In 2018, they left their agency without disbanding. Member Jiyeon hopes for a possible get-together: "We're like family. We have many happy memories. I miss it. It was my youth." They celebrated their decade-long anniversary last year.

The girl group behind "Bar Bar Bar" was so successful in their prime that they were the opening act for Lady Gaga's US tour in 2014. Although inactive, members Way, Choa, and Geunmi made an appearance on KBS' The Return Of Superman and set the bar high in friendship reunions when they met Soyul. They were even introduced to her baby girl, JamJam, with H.O.T's Moon Hee Jun!

Lee Ji Eun, more known as IU, continues to thrive in her acting and singing careers with the top-rated K-drama, Hotel De Luna, and her comeback album Love Poem. She also recently released her OST, "I Give You My Heart", for the hit drama Crash Landing On You, which achieved an all-kill in music charts. The blueming artist had a concert in Manila in December last year and even said "mahal kita" to Ma-aenas via her IG post.

The award-winning legends of K-pop remain to be strong, and started 2020 with a powerful comeback title track, "2YAYAO". Super Junior are long gone from their early days when they reached worldwide status with the iconic "Sorry Sorry", entered the Latin charts as the first K-pop group to do so, and held a special presentation at Oxford University. Currently, the members are busy as a group while also doing their solo activities. They also frequently connect with ELFs through various platforms.

With sold-out concerts in massive arenas around the world, BIGBANG set K-pop standards HIGH and was even hailed as one of TIME's 100 Most Influential of 2016 reader poll. The group's charisma is clearly evident in their tracks and all-out performances, along with hilarious TV guestings that made VIPs fall for them even more. This year, BIGBANG is set to perform in Coachella, a huge recognition for the Hallyu wave.



The boy group with the biggest fan club in the world (they actually have a Guinness World Record to prove it!) continues to soar high, especially in Japan. Together with fellow legends, Super Junior, TVXQ is a part of the Korean travel documentary, YouTube Premium's Analog Trip, where they shared good times with each other.

SHINee's distinct personalities continue to shine since their debut in 2008. Shawols wanted a replay of their hilarious videos, and in 2017, former US President Obama mentioned the group in one of his speeches. Member Jonghyun died in 2017, leaving his fans and fellow members in shock. As of now, the rest of SHINee is currently serving the army while maknae Taemin is part of SM Entertainment's supergroup, SuperM, and is preparing for a solo comeback soon.

Everyone put their hands up for 2PM when they started out in the K-pop scene in 2008. The group is currently inactive (with most members serving in the military), but has never failed to remember their fans, the HOTTESTs. Member Nickhun posted a heartfelt letter in September last year, saying how more than 11 years of his life was best spent with his members, who have become true friends and family.

Formerly known as BEAST, the boys rebranded as HIGHLIGHT (minus their former member, Hyunseung, and Junhyung, following a scandal in 2019) and continued to impress the public with their passion for music and performing after they left their agency in 2017. Just like other second-gen K-pop boy groups, the HIGHLIGHT members are currently serving in the military. The group made a huge donation to the Korean Food for the Hungry International during their 10th anniversary under their fandom's name last year.PETALING JAYA, Feb 24 — K-pop fans are a protective bunch, especially when it comes to Blackpink’s Lisa and Jennie, who are two of the most revered idols in the industry.

So, when an avid fan of Jennie accidentally bumped into Lisa while she was waiting to claim her baggage at the Incheon International Airport, ardent fanatics of the K-pop group were enraged with the fan’s inadvertent bump.

Blackpink returned to South Korea two days ago on February 22 after the culmination of their “Blackpink 2019-2020 Tour in Your Area: Japan”.

In typical fashion, many fans flocked to the airport to try to get a picture of their beloved superstars, just like the fan did in the video.

Without paying attention to his surroundings while trying to take a snap of his favourite idol, Jennie Kim, the fan backed into Lisa with his bag eventually hitting her.

This sparked outrage from Lisa’s congregation of followers as they criticised the man’s ignorant behaviour, as they said he may have caused harm to Lisa.

“It must have hurt based on Lisa’s reaction because the bag hit her body. There must be something hard in the bag,” wrote one user.

“We all know he didn’t mean it, it was just an accident. But at least he should say sorry!” wrote another user.

Other users echoed such statements saying that it didn’t seem as though the man had apologised for bumping into Lisa, while some were more keen on finding out who he is.

The video was uploaded by a Twitter fan page of Lisa, called @_fluffylisa two days ago and has garnered over 5,000 shares.

However, Lisa’s ever-loving fans’ search was cut short, as the man, who is also a social media administrator of a Jennie Kim fan page on Twitter called ‘Paint It Black’, uploaded an apology letter later that day, admitting his fault.

“Hello, this is Paint It Black. On February 22 on my return flight to Seoul from Fukuoka, I’ve accidentally pushed Lisa and caused her harm,” said the letter.

“I was taking pictures without looking around and it caused me to accidentally push over Lisa and this is all my mistake. I apologised right away to Lisa, on the spot, and I deeply regret my wrongdoings.”

His apology post has since received over 6,000 likes, as a majority of Lisa’s protective fans forgave the man, asking him to “be more careful next time”.

Fans were somewhat forgiving after the man apologised for his accidental push. — Screengrab via Twitter/@PaintItBlack_JN But, not everyone was as easily appeased with some fans still managing to find fault with him, saying that he should apologise publicly to Lisa instead of the “BLINKs” (Blackpink fans).Diving straight in with a grandiose operatic intro with dramatic pizzicato strings, Red Velvet’s latest hit bursts into the swooping chorus, “You got me feeling like a psycho, psycho.” For 3 1/2 minutes straight, the five singers showcase their skillful vocals as the story of a hot-and-cold relationship unfolds. Released in December as the lead single from the band’s latest album, “The ReVe Festival: Finale,” “Psycho” continues to please, after topping major weekly music shows for weeks and spawning a slew of positive reviews on YouTube. With all due respect to its other works such as “Zimzalabim” and “Umpah Umpah,” “Psycho” is the most successful release from the group in recent years, both commercially and critically -- a fitting result as the track concludes the “ReVe Festival” trilogy. So what makes the song so great? Well, in the words of the producer of the track, the slow yet rhythmic, danceable but sophisticated tune is a “bop.” “In music, we call this a ‘bop’ -- a song where the rhythm keeps your head constantly moving or ‘bopping,’” says LA-based producer Andrew Scott. It’s the hi-hats and drum beat that keep the song’s pace, he explains. “If you take them out the song could be a laid-back ballad. The syncopation of the hi-hats in the chorus on top of the trap-friendly melody keeps the listener engaged, like if Beethoven’s ‘Fur Elise’ had 808s and hard hitting-kicks.”



The song came to be at S.M.’s songwriting camp in Seoul as Swedish songwriter Cazzi Opeia was put in a group alongside Scott and EJAE.



One day, they were drinking coffee and chatting about life and love before the conversation turned to the feelings that follow a breakup.



“Someone said something like being heartbroken is almost like feeling psycho. We then decided we wanted to write a song with beautiful chords that tells a story about this. And that’s how ‘Psycho’ was born,” Opeia said.



She also worked with Kenzie, a renowned songwriter at S.M., who translated the English lyrics to Korean for “Psycho” as Opeia and EJAE wrote the top line -- melodies and lyrics -- over the instrumental. 



“We kind of felt in the studio while we wrote it that this is something really good,” she added.





Starting off with sophisticated pizzicato strings followed by a verse punctuated by distorted sounds, the track marks one of the quintessential Red Velvet moments -- a group known for being able to do both “Red” -- strong and powerful -- and “Velvet” -- soft and elegant.



As a producer, Scott decided to take advantage of the group’s versatility.



“Red Velvet loves to play off of their classy and bold style so I wanted to blend the two.”



Coming from a classical music background and having produced songs in the R&B and hip-hop world, Scott said it was natural for him to bring those elements into the mix.



“The distortion against the classical chords is psychotic in itself and once Cazzi laid down a couple of ad libs, I took them and added a delay filter that I created called ‘Psychodelic.’”



“Psycho” follows a consistent pattern of hit singles since the band’s debut in 2014.



And six years on, it would appear that Red Velvet shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.



By Yim Hyun-su ( Working on the chords that Scott played on the piano, melodies came naturally for Opeia. And when she sang that operatic melody for the pre-chorus, Scott knew they’d made something unique together.Starting off with sophisticated pizzicato strings followed by a verse punctuated by distorted sounds, the track marks one of the quintessential Red Velvet moments -- a group known for being able to do both “Red” -- strong and powerful -- and “Velvet” -- soft and elegant.As a producer, Scott decided to take advantage of the group’s versatility.“Red Velvet loves to play off of their classy and bold style so I wanted to blend the two.”Coming from a classical music background and having produced songs in the R&B and hip-hop world, Scott said it was natural for him to bring those elements into the mix.“The distortion against the classical chords is psychotic in itself and once Cazzi laid down a couple of ad libs, I took them and added a delay filter that I created called ‘Psychodelic.’”“Psycho” follows a consistent pattern of hit singles since the band’s debut in 2014.And six years on, it would appear that Red Velvet shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.By Yim Hyun-su ( hyunsu@heraldcorp.comThis process is automatic.

Back in January the 27-year-old revealed he has a fiancee, who is not a celebrity and reportedly pregnant.

The K-pop star explained that he was ‘grateful’ for support from fans, but apologised to those who ‘must have been very surprised and taken aback by my sudden news’.

In a statement on the fan message board, he wrote: ‘After worrying a lot about how I should express my feelings, it’s taken me until now to write to EXO-L.

‘I’m worried that I might hurt you through poor wording, but I want to first off apologise to everyone who has waited for all that time. I also want to express my apologies to EXO-L who must have been very surprised and taken aback by my sudden news.

‘When I first wrote that letter, it was my first time too experiencing such a thing, so I worried a lot about what I should say to EXO-L who’ve been together with me. Still, I wrote a letter because I thought that I needed to personally tell all of you first… however, my unintentionally lacking and poor wording caused disappointment and hurt, and seeing you experience that made my heart ache as well.

‘I don’t know if my feelings will be conveyed well, but I’m sincerely grateful for the love that you’ve given me and I’m more aware than anyone else that I am who I am now because of that love.

‘I want to apologise again for expressing my apologies to you so late. Also, I will show you how I’m continuing to try hard. Thank you.’

The April, And A Flower singer revealed his plans to start a family with a handwritten letter posted in January last year.

His agency SM Entertainment added in a statement: ‘Chen has met someone precious to him and will be getting married. The bride is a non-celebrity, and the wedding will be held privately with only their families in attendance.

‘To respect their families’ opinions, the wedding and everything related to it will be held privately, so we ask fans and reporters for their kind understanding.

‘Chen will continue to work hard as an artist. We ask you to send Chen lots of blessings and messages of celebration.’

The singer released second solo album Dear My Dear last year, ahead of EXO’s latest comeback Obsession.

Last year, the company bolstered its leadership team with London-based Global Head of Music Ole Obermann and Los Angeles-based Head of Label Licensing, Tracy Gardner.

And just last month, TikTok inked a multi-territory licensing deal with Merlin, the global digital rights agency for the world’s independent label sector.

The ByteDance-owned company is also understood to be in the middle of licensing negotiations with the majors.

Today brings further evidence of TikTok’s growing clout in music. The platform has nabbed the exclusive premiere of a clip from a new BTS single, ON, taken from the K-pop superstars’ upcoming new album MAP OF THE SOUL: 7 .

TikTok users will be able to listen to the new song 12 hours ahead of the official release of the album and they will also be able to create their TikTok videos using the music.

BTS officially joined TikTok on September 25, 2019, and according to ByteDance soon claimed the world record for fastest time to reach 1 million followers, achieving a record time of 3 hours and 31 minutes.

In the same week, TikTok also launched the band member J-hope’s ‘Chicken Noodle Soup’ challenge in more than 40 countries, which the company says has reached over 480m views.

The group currently have 7.5m followers on the platform.

TikTok’s BTS exclusive comes two days after the platform partnered with the BRIT Awards in London, delivering an exclusive live-stream of event’s red carpet, and a performance by Lewis Capaldi.

Speaking ahead of the BRITs, Rich Waterworth, TikTok’s General Manager UK, said: “On TikTok, artists can reach listeners at lighting speed and build authentic fanbases – it’s a unique connection between artists and fans that we want even more artists and fans to benefit from – as well as the discovery opportunities TikTok brings for success off-platform.”As unfortunate as they are, breakups happen sometimes. They’re usually easier to handle when it’s an amicable separation, but it can get unpleasant if things go south.

If you ever, God forbid, find yourself in a similar situation, the following K-pop songs will hopefully give you the comfort you need when going through such tough times.

There are times when couples take a break to reassess their relationship. Sadly, not all of them get back together, especially if priorities change during the break and they’d rather turn the page and meet someone new. DAY6 beautifully addresses this unfortunate turn of events through heartwrenching lyrics to convey the feeling. One piece of advice the band gives us is that although it stings to be in this situation, it is essential that you put yourself and your feelings first, and allow yourself to heal while you embrace your newly-found freedom.

A narcissistic partner brings irreparable damage to the relationship, which comes to an end most of the time. MAMAMOO seems to know a thing or two about this, and they don’t shy away from sharing their piece of mind with us through “Egotistic.” The quartet insists on placing yourself first instead of looking after your significant other’s well-being and suggests that the best alternative is to take the high road and free yourself. If you should learn anything from this flamboyant track, it would be to take care of yourself and to confidently prepare to be on your own.

A heartless love is perhaps the epitome of oxymorons, and BLACKPINK gives us lessons to “Kill This Love” and be done with it once and for all. Through this hit, they show us how this dangerous situation comes to be, which often happens when one or both partners disregard the other’s feelings, leaving room for deception. Albeit heartbreaking, the best way to save yourself from this fate is to put an end to this toxic love and start living again.

G-dragon is one of the best songwriters in the music industry, and for good reason. In “Crooked,” he tells the story of the aftermath that follows a couple separating. Life may feel meaningless for a while, and sometimes, the built-in frustration translates to mischief, rebellion, and everything in between, all of which is a means to blow off steam. That exact moment is when you should take time for yourself and go over your past relationship inside your head, in an attempt to identify all the red flags you previously missed and to work on mending your broken heart.

Cutting ties can happen in such a cold and distant manner, which tends to be painful. IU has a unique way of portraying that exact feeling in her MV as she serenades us with her sweet and powerful voice. Through the lines, she tells us that getting used to your ex’s indifference for so long gives you a clear idea of the future partner that you want to be with, and that despite the current circumstances, you can only wish them well in their love life.

In this hypnotic single, (G)I-DLE draws our attention to how most love stories start with sugar-coated talk, and rare are those that stand the test of time. The girls emphasize how you suddenly find yourself in front of a completely different person who gave nothing but empty promises, and whom you can’t even recognize anymore. That’s when you decide that it’s time to pull the plug on this relationship and erase them from your heart and mind.

BTS walks us through the process of saving a relationship before you realize it’s all in vain. They show that despite doing everything to save your love such as changing for your partner, making sacrifices, and hiding your pain for the sake of their happiness; at the end of the day, you realize that the feelings bringing you together are fake and you cannot possibly keep going in an aimless direction. Surely, it takes more than just an emotional bond to make relationships work, but even then, not all efforts are appreciated.

2NE1 sung of heartbreak as much as they did of love, and this melodramatic song and MV are living proof. These fine ladies movingly share how it hurts enough when you find out that you were cheated on, but the pain only gets worse when you catch them red-handed and unapologetic about it. With this in mind, the badass group admits that what’s done is done and all you need to do right now is look after yourself. Granted, you’ll walk away and let go of love and sadness for the sake of your peace of mind.

As SISTAR points it out in their suave jam, sometimes, you just want to sit by yourself and think about everything that went wrong between you and your ex and simply cry it out of your system. The song also shows that processing your emotions is no easy task, and you don’t have to deal with them until you’re positively ready to shelf this chapter of your life and move on.

Chen confesses that addressing things becomes so much easier after breaking up and that tension arises in the heat of the moment. Through the song, he advises us to keep in mind that even when the separation itself can’t get any worse, bidding your former significant other farewell and wishing them well can grant you such solace that you wouldn’t even have expected. This way, you can cherish the moments you two once shared without having to carry the burden of an ugly breakup.

Which K-pop song comforts you most? Let us know in the comments below!While Spotify has celebrated multiple anniversaries across the globe, it’s now celebrating its first anniversary in India. While the streaming service hasn’t shared numbers that would help us quantify its journey in terms of subscribers, they’ve shed light on some really interesting stats and listening habits.

For starters, India ranks the highest in the number of 18-24-year-old users on Spotify in the world. Considering that it’s been only here for a year, this is quite remarkable. Although a distinct number could’ve helped with more perspective on just how much this fact means.

Another interesting revelation is the popularity of K-pop in India. For six of India’s 7 sisters - Arunachal, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura – Korean features in the top 3 languages of music consumption. But if we talk about the top 10 cities that consume K-pop, Jaipur and Ahmedabad also make it to the Top 10 list.

Spotify says that it’s received a lot of interest from users aged 55 and above too. I’m not sure if these guys confused the song for the Senorita that features in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, but Señorita by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello is the most streamed track across the country in this age group. Dissecting this audience by gender, Spotify says that while females are listening to tracks from artists like EXO, and BLACKPINK, the males are tuning in to Selena Gomez’s and Eli Sostre’s songs.

Although, what unites India is their love for love songs. The affinity for such tracks is even stronger in eastern states like West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, Bihar, and Sikkim.

While a report from Bloomberg that came out in December last year stated that the service wasn't growing as fast as YouTube's offering, Spotify’s latest earning report claimed that it has 124 million premium subscribers around the world, which is more than twice of what Apple Music last reported.

While Spotify has shown considerable growth in its first year in India, it’s limited music library still poses as a roadblock for many users. Not to forget that YouTube Music and local players like Gaana and Saavn are also showing no signs of stopping. And if all that wasn’t enough, ByteDance – the company that owns TikTok – has also launched a beta of its own music streaming service, Resso. Given how much TikTok has impacted the Indian market, it’d be wise to not underestimate what Resso could do.BTS have led K-pop’s domination of pop music and have been streamed billions of times on Spotify.British K-Pop star, Oli London has become the worlds first K-Pop artist to feature a trans-woman in his new music video. The London and Las Vegas based singer, who has had two top 10 hits in the iTunes K-Pop chart is most famous for his appearances on U.S. TV shows Dr. Phil, E! Botched and Daily Mail TV as well as British channel Barcroft TV and Today Show Australia. He is also well known for his relationship with Celebrity Big Brother star Frenchy Morgan.

The lyrics for his latest single Mirror Mirror, sung in both Korean and English feature a strong message about online haters and trolls that target young people, particularly LGBTQI+ people on the internet.

The chorus ‘Mirror Mirror’ focuses on the notion that these ‘haters’ should turn the mirror on themselves and see their own reflection.



 Everyone has the power to choose their own reflection, to choose who they want to be. So by turning the mirror on themselves they are given a choice to change their attitude and be more positive, accepting of others or continue judging others and seeing an unhappy reflection of themselves.

Oli, who is Europe’s first male K-Pop artist felt that it was very important to feature a trans-woman and LGBTQI+ people in his new music video to send a strong message to the world and in particular to the K-Pop world where LGBTQI people are sidelined and never given the opportunity to express themselves and be open.

He said ‘For me, music has no boundaries and everyone has the right to express themselves through music regardless of sexuality, gender or any other factors. I wanted to break the norm and break the stigma with Kpop and celebrate trans women and LGBTQI+ so in my new music video Jessica James, who is a prominent UK trans activist, singer and actress features in a scene’.

Korea and Korean culture, while being very rich and diverse in many ways, is particularly conservative and does not accept openly LGBTQI + and trans people so, Oli hopes that through his new video the K-Pop community can become more accepting and open with trans women and the LGBTQI+ community and celebrate and embrace the enormous contribution and value they add to the world.

The British singer had over 1.2 million views on his debut single Perfection and has had 2 top 10 hits and a top 40 single on iTunes.

Rin: My nickname is Rin. I'm 22 years old and I'm the head admin of Lucas Philippines and a member of ELFzen Events.

SJUPH: We are Super Junior United Philippines, or SJUPH, a non-profit, non-sectarian, and non-political fan club for the South Korean boy group, Super Junior.

When did you become a fan of K-pop

Rin: I got into K-pop in my first year of high school back in 2010. I got to know about Super Junior first when "Sorry, Sorry" and "Bonamana" were being played at my school fair. I got into other groups as well like 2PM, BIGBANG, SS501, SHINee, and TVXQ. I've been a fan of NCT since their 2014 SMRookies days, but I became a more active fan in 2016 when [sub-unit] NCT U debuted.

SJUPH: Our fan club was founded on September 5, 2008. SJUPH was the unification of the country's four largest Super Junior fan clubs at that time, with the aim of uniting all Filipino Super Junior fans locally and abroad, as well as giving all our support to Super Junior.

What is a cup sleeve event? Could you describe what usually happens during one?

Rin: A cup sleeve event is a way for fans to celebrate the birthdays or accomplishments of their fave artists by having their faces printed on designed sleeves placed on drinks at selected cafe venues. A typical cup sleeve event consists of a group of people or a fanbase celebrating a certain event at a chosen cafe.

The organizers prepare cup sleeves that they have designed for a certain artist, which are given to the cafe staff to distribute to attendees with every purchased drink. Organizers also come on the day of the event they're heading so they can interact with other fans and hand out special freebies.

SJUPH: A cup sleeve event is a common way for fans to celebrate the birthday or debut anniversary of their idol. These celebrations are usually held at coffee or milk tea shops. Fans who attend buy drinks and present their receipts to the cup sleeve event organizer in exchange for freebies. Typical freebies include a cup sleeve (of course), photocards, and bookmarks. Sometimes, organizers will do raffle draws for the attendees as well.

Have you organized fandom events other than cup sleeve events

SJUPH: SJUPH is the first individual fan club that organized a solo convention here in the Philippines. We also do charity work with our co-fans, PH ELFs, as volunteers. Plus, we've organized fan-themed gatherings like pajama parties and [an] amazing race, as well as album launches and regional film showings.

What do you love most about organizing and attending events like this?

Rin: I enjoy interacting with other fans. I'm an introvert, so getting to know people and learning the best way to observe them as I talk to them is very interesting to me. Plus, I get to make new friends!

SJUPH: We love to see our co-PH ELFs happy and enjoying what we prepared for them.

How many cup sleeve events have you organized?

Rin: I have organized two events so far. My first event with ELFzen Events was Eminence, a cup sleeve event celebrating Super Junior Donghae and NCT 127 Yuta's birthdays in October. I also planned Maison des Jokers, a cup sleeve event slash photo exhibit by Lucas Philippines to celebrate WayV/NCT/SuperM Lucas's birthday last January. As for collaboration events, Lucas PH is affiliated with WayV Union PH so we've made WayV events such as Dream Launch celebrating WayV's first 100 days since debut, and The Spring Equinox, a cup sleeve event that celebrated WayV's first year anniversary.

SJUPH: As of now, we have organized two cup sleeve events, including the Timeless event to celebrate Super Junior's 14th anniversary.

How long does it usually take to prepare for cup sleeve and non-cup sleeve events? What are the challenges of organizing them?

Rin: It usually takes two months or more to prepare for a cup sleeve event depending on how elaborate you want it to be. It takes about three weeks to a month to settle designs for sleeves and other publicity material needed to promote your event. Online management of attendees will also be done if the event has an entrance fee or if a headcount for pre-registration is needed.

As for non-cup sleeve events, it takes three months of planning to book a venue and select participating fanbases to help out with task labor, based on my prior experience with gatherings for NCT Philippines. The challenge of organizing an event is [trying to make] all plans fall into place. The expenses are financially-challenging because you need to spend more if you want your events to have more inclusions or [be] unique. Simply booking a venue for events is already expensive because of cafe rental fees and corkage fees if you want to bring in food to give away or to display a cake.

SJUPH: Ideally, for us fans who have day jobs, it takes two to three months of preparation for a cup sleeve event. For a non-cup sleeve event, for example, big gatherings like conventions, it usually takes six to eight months of planning.

How much does it cost to hold fan events? Who funds it?

Rin: For simple cup sleeve events with no program, about P3,000 to P4,000 for all freebies, cup sleeve production expenses, and designs is enough. For bigger events or fan gatherings, P4,000 is not enough!

For small events, funding is usually done by the hosts of the event. For big events hosted by fanbases, they usually get funds by organizing pre-ordered tickets for attendees or through fundraising. If urgent funds are needed, they ask for funding contributions from each staff member.

SJUPH: For a cup sleeve event, [it costs around] P8,000 to P10,000. We fund our own events. We get money from selling official merch, from fan donations, and sometimes funds from our own pockets.

How do you promote your events?

Rin: We usually promote our events via official accounts on Twitter and Facebook. Posting on merchandise groups or fanbase groups on Facebook also helps.

SJUPH: We have Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts.

What's your advice to fans who want to organize their own cup sleeve events or other fandom-related events?

Rin: Take the opportunity to do so because the memories that events can give you are unforgettable. Aside from checking if you're financially capable of making your desired event happen, make sure to surround yourself with friends who are passionate and collaborative enough to help you make things successful.

Organizing an event by yourself is possible, but getting people to help you is such a great feeling because you get to share your accomplishments with others. To fans who are members of fanbases, learn to make the staff in your fanbases your friends, or better yet, your family. Don't treat them as staff to boss around when you don't get what you want. Treating your co-staff members well strengthens their relationship with you and makes event planning less stressful.

The event organizing process will always be stressful because problems are inevitable, but if you get along with everyone, you will be able to solve problems together. Lastly, maintain good communication at all times, and make sure everyone stays informed. Stay transparent and most of all, treat everyone with the respect they deserve.

SJUPH: As long as you are happy in what you want to do, go for it!

*Answers have been edited for clarity.Die weitere Ausbreitung des neuartigen Coronavirus wirkt sich auch auf die Musikindustrie aus. Zahlreiche K-Pop-Showcases sowie Konzerte inner- und außerhalb Koreas in diesem Monat wurden abgesagt oder durch Online-Events ersetzt.

Seventeen hat wegen dem Virenausbrauch ihre Welttournee „Ode to You“ absagen müssen. Als Tourstationen waren Kuala Lumpur, Taipeh, Madrid, Paris, London und Berlin geplant gewesen.

Die Girlgroup Gfriend präsentierte ihr Debüt-Showcase für „回:Labyrinth“ online ohne Fans. Auch Loona stellte online ihre Comeback-Darbietung für ihr neues Album „#“ vor.

Die Boyband Pentagon wird ebenfalls diese Woche ihr erstes Album voller Länge „Universe: the Black Hall“ online präsentieren.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- K-pop superstars BTS canceled an upcoming concert series in South Korea's capital as the country that exports entertainment worldwide tries to contain a soaring virus outbreak.

It follows a near-shutdown of entertainment in hard-hit parts of China, the world's second-biggest economy and second-biggest box-office market.

BTS, which performed at the Grammys and at New York's Grand Central Terminal for "The Tonight Show" in recent weeks is seen as an emblem of South Korea's cultural and economic power.

Its management company said the current outbreak in South Korea made it impossible to predict what the situation would be on the expected concert dates in April.The line of concertgoers that snaked into the Provident Credit Union Event Center at San Jose State University looked similar to fans at any other boy band show. Because the headliner is South Korean K-pop sensation Stray Kids, many were clutching light sticks, homemade banners and headbands.

On this particular night, however, there was one additional accessory: face masks.

The unstylish trend has been popping up throughout the Bay Area at malls, grocery stores and now at concerts as concern over the spread of the coronavirus grows. On Thursday, Feb. 13, a few people in the queue were sporting them, while others had masks tucked away for later.

At many K-pop concerts, fans can purchase a “hi-touch” ticket that allows them to meet the stars after the show. They gather in a room, form a line, and then high-five the group. It’s an exclusive, if pricey, elevated level of engagement. But because of coronavirus fears, the tour promoter SubKulture Entertainment worked with medical professionals and Stray Kids’ management company to implement an extra element of safety. To enter the hi-touch line, each fan must undergo inspection with a thermal scanner, take a dollop of hand sanitizer and wear a mask.

More than 66,000 cases of coronavirus, a disease that originated in China, have been confirmed worldwide, with the first case confirmed in Santa Clara County on Jan. 31. With the way the disease is spreading, precautions taken at the Stray Kids meet-and-greet are likely to become the norm.

Coronavirus hits Bay Area: What residents need to know

Joyce Kim, a K-pop fan from Washington, D.C., came prepared and pulled out a box of masks she brought with her. She passed a few out to three girls with hi-touch tickets who forgot to bring them. With that crisis averted, the girls joked about meeting their idols while wearing the strappy gauze across their faces, but their excitement didn’t wane. They talked about maybe writing messages on the masks in Korean so the boys could read them.

Kim said she doesn’t mind the “ounce of prevention” attitude. The eight members of Stray Kids are Asian artists who will eventually return to Asia. Keeping them safe, healthy and at ease will supersede any self-consciousness about meeting their idols mano-a-mano with their faces half covered.

“I would rather wear the mask than have the hi-touch canceled,” Kim said. “I think the excitement’s already there. The fact you get to meet them and give them a high-five is going to override the doubts of wearing a mask.”

Stray Kids grow up to dazzle the K-pop world

Review: K-pop supergroup SuperM keeps spirits high in San Jose during Super BowlFebruary may be known as the month of love because of Valentine’s Day, but that doesn’t mean people who are riding solo should be singled out. This playlist was made to root for all the singles ladies and gentlemen out there as they proudly embrace their solitary lifestyle.

Here are eight K-pop songs that are great anthems to help you celebrate being single.

Just like Jennie over here, shining solo is a bliss you wouldn’t know about until you walk out of a meaningless relationship. Liberating yourself and working on your strengths and goals is all you need for personal growth, and that’s more than enough.

Strong independent women pull through! This one is for anyone who has proven to themselves and the world that they can cater to their own needs without counting on anybody else all while thriving in life.

Being alone is not always a bad thing. There is a certain comfort in doing things by yourself, whether it’s going to the movies, enjoying a Karaoke session, or ordering a big meal just for yourself. Some people simply do well on their own!

If you’re single because you got cheated on, then you’ve definitely dodged a bullet. Unfaithful relationships are a source of constant anxiety and hurt. So instead of worrying for two, how about you take time to relax, care for yourself, and enjoy the solo life?

Just because you’re single doesn’t mean you’re available. Plus, it takes more than cheesy pickup lines and obvious moves to get your attention. You are adamant to make the most of your single life before you fall for someone, especially when they try to make you swoon with predictable sugar-coated talk.

Sometimes, it takes time and preparation to move on and start over. With this in mind, forgetting about the past and blooming again is the best way to kickstart your solo journey. What are you waiting for? Leave it all behind!

This one serves as a major confidence boost and is a reminder that you’re perfect and you’re worth it. So live your life to the fullest and remember: You’ll always win hearts with your personality, and that’s all you need to know.

Now this track may sound like it’s meant for people who are getting ready to go back in the dating game, but the lyrics that lead up to the hook show just how much progress is made when it comes to one’s own person. Having a good time and growing braver, stronger, and more confident are things that only you can work on and improve by yourself.

Which K-pop song represents how you feel about being single? Let us know in the comments below!Rising K-Pop stars The Boyz love having so many members in their team.

The boy group boasts 11 members: Sangyeon, Jacob, Younghoon, Hyunjae, Juyeon, Kevin, New, Q, Juhaknyeon, Sunwoo, and Eric.

Having all these performers in one group makes for some impressive choreography and an exciting range of vocals.

And according to the boys themselves the large group allows for ’11 different interpretations of a song’, so we get to hear their concepts from a wide range of viewpoints.

They also gave some insight into their stage outfits and how it reflects them as idols.

‘Yes they do reflect our team’s personality and from 소년 (Boy), to D.D.D and also Tattoo, it really shows our growth and just how when we’re all together as a team and you see us together, our stage outfits elevate us even more and give fans even more to think about and look out for.’

Kevin added: ‘I think even though it seems like we’re matching, we have little variations that reflects each member’s personality which I think is cool.’

Read on to find out what else they had to say.

Having impressed their fans with White, The Boyz are gearing up for their upcoming album Reveal, which will be their first full-length album.

And it looks like their wish to write more songs for the group has come true, with Sunwoo and Eric both contributing raps to the songs Scar and Spring Snow.

Despite this, the boy band’s growing popularity outside the East Asian nation shows no signs of slowing down.

Last month, the band wrapped up the North American leg of their “Ode to You” world tour. They are set to make a stopover in Manila on February 8, which will be their fourth concert in the country.

Seventeen is a multinational boy band that debuted under Pledis Entertainment, one of the relatively popular K-pop companies. The band’s name was taken from the sum of three numbers significant to the group — 13 members in three “sub-units” (or smaller groups within an act, in K-pop jargon) that come together to form one team.

For those who are not into K-pop, a 13-piece act may seem like a dizzying concept. Seventeen, however, have used their number to their advantage. Each member offers something unique to the team.

Seventeen also take in pride in being a “self-producing” group, with the members largely involved in the production of their music and stage performances.

In their early years, Seventeen won fans’ hearts with their brass-heavy, upbeat tunes and boyish image. In 2017, however, the band shifted to a more mature sound and image through the EDM track “Don't Wanna Cry.” Since then, the group have continued to explore various genres, with each new song serving as a testament to the act’s versatility.

Last year, Seventeen released “An Ode,” which sold over half a million copies in its first week, bagged a “daesang” (grand prize) for Album of the Year in the Asia Artist Award, and was named K-pop album of the year by critics from music publication Billboard.

With at least a dozen singles to date, Seventeen’s discography is teeming with memorable songs that set them apart from other male acts. Here, we look at the ones that stand out from the group’s catalog:

The planned concert is part of the Korean government's various projects for the celebration of the 30th anniversary of establishing its diplomatic relations with Russia in 2020.



Along with the concert, South Korea will hold a trade fair in Russia this year, Hong said. 



South Korea has been seeking to expand cooperation with Russia, especially in the materials, parts and equipment segment on top of the traditionally strong ties in the shipbuilding and automobile industries.

Walking around the Korean Market at Irvine you can see the windows bouncing from the loud music coming from a shop at the end of the alley. A big screen displaying colorful music videos and people wandering around the tiny store. There was no Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande playing in the background, it was K-pop.

Thanks to the catchy beats, dance choreographies and movie-like music videos, K-pop has become a global phenomenon, riding the Hallyu Wave. The Hallyu Wave is a Chinese term that describes the popularity of the Korean entertainment industry. From the Korean cosmetics and skincare routines to the Korean dramas on Netflix.

“I typically enjoy upbeat and uplifting music,” said Emily Lowry, who’s been a fan of K-pop groups since 2015. “It makes me feel happy and it reminds me of concerts or moments in my life that I’ve enjoyed.”

Modern Korean pop grew in the 1990s, but the genre’s popularity ascended in the past few years. The first time most people heard about K-pop was in 2012, when Psy’s “Gangnam Style” became the first video to top a billion streams on YouTube. Although now the internet sees that song as a meme, it opened the doors for the worldwide sensation that K-pop is today.

“I’ve found a home and a place where I feel comfortable,” says Madelon Hellen, runner of an Instagram fanpage (@jooheonday) with over 76 thousand followers. “I have met so many incredible people because of K-pop. I’ve been to so many concerts, parties and experiences that I would’ve never done before.”

K-pop has become difficult to ignore on the pop culture scene. Even when the tracks are in Korean, every song appears to stand against international competition. Groups like BLACKPINK and BTS hold records for their music videos with “Kill This Love” and “Boy With Luv” having over 56.7 million views.

According to the Guinesses World Records, BTS holds the biggest most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours. “Boy With Luv” currently has over 642 million views making it the biggest music video debut in YouTube history.

“It’s so visually pleasing.” said Maddi Gjovik, UC Berkeley graduate student and BTS fan. “The monochromatic outfits set the tone of the song very well. Definitely caught my attention throughout.”

K-pop has the traditional melody of Western Pop. The only difference between both is that K-pop is in Korean. And even so, Korean groups sing in English, Chinese and Japanese to attract diverse audiences. Their songs have elements from different music genres like rock, R&B, hip-hop, electronic dance and now Latin pop.

Without One Direction, BTS became the biggest boyband in the market. With their “ARMY” fanbase and millions of screaming crowds, they have taken K-pop from an unknown genre to a $5 billion industry.

Korean artists are setting the tone by providing content to the biggest producer and consumer of media in the world, the United States. They hold events like K-Con where the korean culture takes over Los Angeles Convention Center and brings different aspects of the K-pop culture like beauty, food, influencers, meet-and-greets and music into one place.

The first K-Con was in 2012 with only a few hundred fans and locals. Today, there are over 125,000 fans coming together for K-Con LA and K-Con New York. The convention shows a diverse audience of age and culture, which reflects on the popularity of K-pop outside of Korea.

But what makes K-pop music so addictive? Their quality live performances and top-notch choreographies makes every audience turn around and stare. They have a very unique and clean aesthetic, which also attracts more people. The positive lyrics and upbeat songs allows people to relate and explore more K-pop.

Research from the Koran Foundation says there was a 22% increase in the number of fans from 73 million in 2017 to over 80 million in 2018. This was thanks to the success of the boy band BTS, who debuted at K-Con in 2014.

K-pop fans don’t hesitate in learning all the choreographies and buying every version of the same album just to maintain their collection intact. Even at concerts you can find K-pop fans signing lyrics they barely understand. They are creating a revolution to keep this industry international, but fans want you to know that they are not what the media portrays them to be.

“Not everyone who enjoys and actively listens to K-pop is a crazy fangirl,” said Brent Boucher, Monsta X and BTS fanatic. “People can strongly identify with the groups they like while keeping it casual and relaxed.”

Judging people for the way they act, speak or for what they like is outdated. And even though society is more open now than ever to embrace all cultures, there’s still people who like to “trash” K-pop fanatics.

“It’s difficult as a young teenager to be a fan of anything really because you’re constantly ridiculed for something you enjoy,” said Hannah Gjovik, college student. “As I’ve grown older, whenever I see people ‘trash talking’ on K-pop, I pay no attention to it. People should let others enjoy things they like.”

Many fans have to go through the “shame” of liking K-pop, mostly because of the internet trolls. But at this point, their community is so massive that any type of hate is nothing more than background noise.

“It still bothers me a little, but I know everyone has different opinions,” said Gjovik. “It’s OK to like different things.”

Because of the control South Korean music studios hold over their artists, they are the ones responsible for shaping the K-pop genre. It’s been controversial the way they handle their own performers. From long-term contracts, also known as “slave contracts,” to abusive behavior over the artists, most of them are not allowed to have a social life or even date.

Although it seems like these K-pop groups are in need of salvation, that’s the life they signed up for. They’ve become the face of South Korea strategically designed to elevate its culture worldwide. As the consumers continue feeding the production system, the K-pop machine goes on, and it doesn’t look like the hallyu wave is ending any time soon.

Correction- an earlier post cited information from “ResearchGate” when the information came from “The Korea Foundation.”Amid the coronavirus outbreak, concert-goers attending the upcoming show by South Korean boy band NCT Dream in Istora Senayan stadium in Jakarta on March 1 will be required to go through a body temperature check prior to entering the venue, according to an announcement issued by the promoter.

"All audience members must go through a body temperature check that will be conducted prior to entering the venue," read the announcement issued by concert promoter Mecima Pro on its social media accounts. "If you are measured as having a body temperature above normal [>37.5 Celsius degrees], we will ask you to go through a further health check-up at a specialized area that will be provided at the venue."

Those who already feel unfit will be required to bring along a doctor’s note that states their health condition and that they are allowed to attend the show.

If the medical team at the venue decides that the audience member is unhealthy and may pose a risk of disease infection to others, they will be prevented from attending the show.

Concert-goers are also recommended to bring along their own face masks and to wear them during the show if necessary, as well as hand sanitizer and tissues to maintain self-hygiene.

NCT Dream is a subunit of South Korean boy group NCT. The group debuted on Aug. 25, 2016 with a single titled “Chewing Gum”.

On September 2019, NCT Dream was included in Billboard’s 21 Under 21 list for the second year in a row.

The band was supposed to perform in Singapore on Feb. 15, but in late January decided to postpone the show over coronavirus fears. (gis/kes)Don't Freak Out When We Guess Your Relationship Status From Your Favorite K-Pop Idols

Are you a ~boy with luv~ or going ~solo~?He is the first K-Pop idol to be openly gay in the South Korean music industry.

And Holland detailed his experiences since revealing his sexuality when he debuted in 2018 with his hit song Neverland, the first K-Pop music video to show a same-sex kiss on screen.

The singer, 23, talked exclusively to MailOnline following his first European tour, and spoke passionately about supporting his fans and the LGBTQ+ community, as well as his experiences within the industry.

Holland, whose real name is Go Tae-seob, shared his determination to help others, saying: 'People look to me to represent the LGBT community in Korea at the moment, they support me and look at me that way so there’s no reason for me to refuse.

'I will fight for the rights of the LGBT community in Korea. All the actions that I foresee from my music, the message that I send, and what I write, all of that intends to resolve and change the traditionalist views in Korea.'

Homosexuality is not illegal in South Korea, which in 2003 ended its classification as 'harmful and obscene', and there is growing public acceptance of LGBTQ+ relations and annual gay pride rallies attract thousands.

However, discrimination remains widespread and gay people suffer hate crimes, according to campaigners, while conservative lawmakers are also pushing to end protections for sexual minority groups.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a Catholic widely seen as a liberal, has come under fire for refusing to legalise gay marriage although he has said discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is not acceptable.

On if he ever had any difficulties in the industry because he's openly gay, Holland admits: 'I never had issues with people I worked with, and I feel like if someone had an issue with me because of my sexuality then they wouldn’t even work with me in the first place.

'I never had a hard time, personally. One of my goals is even if someone has an issue with me because of my sexuality, I hope that by working with them then they will have a different mindset.

'People are uncomfortable with [others being gay], but me speaking up about it has made those who thought they were uncomfortable with it get used to it.'

Though, when asked if he ever felt directly discriminated against he pauses, before saying: 'In Korea? I can’t say no to that.

'There were a couple of times I caught on to the fact a person was uncomfortable with me. But I never had a direct conversation or confrontation with someone who said, "I don’t like you because you’re gay".'

And he goes on to add happily: 'In the music business in Korea there are a lot of people who are open-minded and supportive of the LGBT community so I have been supported by a couple of people.'

Starting his career as an independent artist in K-Pop, Holland admits that he feels the traditional trajectory in the industry 'doesn’t really suit [him]', though he is quick to point out that he isn't trying to criticise any big music labels or groups.

'[Companies] mould them into what they think will be the best for them,' he explains. 'So, what the company and the artist must do is divided equally, its very distinct.

'There are other elements that artists focus on, but the main things they do is practice singing and dancing. But, for me, my focus is finding a crew who are able to support and help me tell the message that I want to send to fans.

'I've been doing it a long time by myself, and because of that I've become stubborn because I have my own way of doing things. I’m a little bit bossy!'

Holland's decision to follow his own path has clearly worked in his favour though, as his music boasts millions of views on YouTube, his debut track Neverland has been streamed 12 million times, while his single Loved You Better has gotten over 2 million views since its release two months ago.

The singer's first European tour saw him perform at the ULU in London to an adoring crowd of fans, with many bringing flags from all ends of the LGBTQ+ spectrum to fly during the concert to represent their respective sexual identities.

The singer's affection is evident as he talks about the experience, and admits: 'When I was younger, I went through the same things that my fans are going through, or probably going through now, and it was very hard for me to do that.

'During that period of time I was very inspired and felt support by listening to pop singers who supported the LGBT community, and in the K-Pop scene in Korea it’s still a taboo to support the LGBT community, or to have a conversation about it.

'I felt we should have someone in K-Pop who can support the younger generation who are going through a hard time because of their sexuality, so that’s why I decided to become a singer.'

Holland often uses his personal life as inspiration for his music, explaining how songs I'm So Afraid and I'm Not Afraid from his self-titled debut album represented the fear he felt about coming out to his family, but also how he felt when he realised he had support from his fans.

His latest track Loved You Better continues this idea, and sees the singer look back on his struggles while at school, as he admits the song was 'mostly focused on trying to help and heal my fans, it felt like something that I had to do for them.'

The gratitude Holland feels for the support of his fans is obvious from the way he speaks about them, gushing about how he wants to write songs that support them.

'I didn’t expect to get this much love from my fans since my debut, really,' he says, the appreciation he feels evident in the tone of his voice.

'I have so many positive and supportive friends around me, and I’m so proud of that and so I want to do my best for them,' he adds.

Of where he'd like to see his career go next, Holland reveals his desire to tour in 'more conservative' countries where he feels he can 'bring value and meaning' by representing the LGBT community for fans.

'Somewhere where its more conservative, like Korea. It’s important to me to go where the fans need me and want to meet me the most.

'So, I want to remember as an artist to fly to countries to show fans my support, rather than just be focused on commercial success.'I listen to a lot of music, but I’m picky about the groups I let near my heart. Girl groups are even tougher for me. Today, we’re going to talk about one of them: Brown Eyed Girls. I don’t think it’s a stretch to call this foursome iconic. While they haven’t been as chart-topping as SNSD or BoA, their influence subtly permeates through K-Pop.

When most K-pop groups debut, the members’ ages run between 16-20. Jea, Narsha and Miryo debuted at 25. And, yes, 25 is hardly old. But ageism is still a big obstacle people, especially women, face. With “Abracadabra,” they flaunted their maturity in ways seniors like Lee Hyori and Baek Ji-young did. And only a year into their careers.

While not the first group to do a “bad girl” concept, it’s certainly a game-changer. Firstly, they released this in a sea of more girls groups with cute comebacks. The only video that year with similar feels was SNSD’s “Genie,” which still plays it flirty but innocent. “Abracadabra,” however, has none of that.

The opening 30 seconds is a potent start. Narsha gets dressed in a lush bedroom. There’s no doubt as to what the two were up to. He’s sleeping shirtless, and she has … um … a bad case of bed hair. The real sucker punch comes when she straps a bomb to his chest and leaves. Like the absolute diva she is!! Do you see what I mean by grown woman swag? Even now, over a decade later, not many idols can pull a move like this.

It’s impossible to talk about the video without the dance. The powerful combination made the group a household name. I didn’t get into K-Pop until 2012, but I’ve seen this dance parodied numerous times. Psy even features it in his “Gentleman” video, along with a cameo from Ga-In, Brown Eyed Girls’ “maknae.” The Arrogant Dance is fierce and taunting. It dares the viewer to come closer but knows it won’t happen. Pulls you in and also intimidates you. With a simple move, it allowed women to be as cocky as men. To smirk and charm rather than to giggle and invite.

Brown Eyed Girls honestly have a ton of videos I could discuss, both as a group and solo tracks. However, when I started this article, “Sign” immediately drew me in.

Production-wise, it sounds like your average synth-heavy, late-2000s pop track. The video is also similar to big action movie storytelling. The man must fight his way through hordes of baddies. “Sign,” however, takes it to a different place. This time the man fights to save the group. The ladies are chained in individual glass chambers filled with water. At the last minute, the foursome drowns as “The Man” and the audience helplessly watch. It’s never framed as heroic or epic.

This is, unfortunately, a common writing device called “Fridging the Girlfriend.” The Hero’s love interest is injured or killed, thus springing the Hero into action. Coined by Gail Simone, it refers to an infamous “Green Lantern” panel. Kyle Rayner comes home and discovers his girlfriend’s dead body stuffed in a refrigerator.

Why am I talking about it here? Because unlike most action videos, the group isn’t there to fight, to look fabulous or even to have agency. The women of Brown Eyed Girls are solely there to inspire the hero onward to fight but tragically do not survive. If the video started with their deaths, we’d at least feel like justice was served. “The Man” is our avenging angel, taking down the evildoers. But he’s not. Those deaths are meaningless and empty, just like the fridging device itself.

Another example is “Sixth Sense.” Again, it falls under a common music video theme. This time, the “Group leads modern Revolution.” The video’s imagery is powerful. You see every member imprisoned in various ways. Narsha caged, an audience observing her like an animal, JeA on the cusp of drowning and Ga-in and Miryo handcuffed in front of their respective cameras. Even in the dance portions, their makeup is smudged and looks eerily like bruises.

What’s especially interesting is it’s not staged in the future or alternate earth. Dystopian works often offer an explanation of what went wrong. “Sixth Sense,” however, implies this could be the near future or even now. If the past few years have shown us anything, it’s people in power trying to silence women.

These are just a few examples of Brown Eyed Girls showing their agency and that they’re not pretty toys to be maneuvered.

When they’re the main characters of their videos, they continue to play with gender roles and themes.

The “Kill Bill” movie series follows The Bride seeking revenge against her former fellow assassins and former lover, Bill. While most of the important characters are women, Bill’s influence propels the plot and looms in the shadows. He’s the first person named, his actions are the inciting incident and he’s the end goal.

Beautifully contrasting, Brown Eyed Girls’ “Kill Bill” doesn’t even have a Bill character. The video heavily uses the films’ iconography such as the whistling, showdown in the trailer and costuming. Just … no Bill! Narsha writes “Bill” in Hangul on some guy’s back but that’s it. We don’t even see his face when he’s there. He’s essentially a human prop. The video title card even has Bill’s name crossed out.

With Bill left out, B.E.G delivers a video of the four of them cosplaying as Kill Bill characters while trying to kill each other. Are they friends whose friendship turned sour? Are they each other’s competition? I honestly have no idea! It’s less about revenge and more “Murder is fun,” which I’m absolutely here for.

The dance version continues to use men as props. The ladies first appear reclining onto the male dancer. Later, Ga-in sits on them, the four dancers staged as parts of her throne. The men aren’t even really dancing until over a minute into the video. Meanwhile, the female dancers interact more directly with the choreography and the group itself.

Brown Eyed Girls debuted 14 years ago, the oldest girl group with the same members and no hiatuses. Over the years, K-pop has evolved, partially due to these women. You can see the traces of influence in interesting places. Sunmi‘s duality in “Gashina” and Mamamoo‘s maturity in their performances and sound. You can even see it in how Hyuna constantly balances being provocative, coy and playful.

The foursome recently released their latest album, “Re:Vive,” a compilation of songs covered in their own styles. Right when you thought they’d slow down in their careers … NOPE! They’re dressed in suits, surrounded by drag queens. The grown woman swag, y’all. Never doubt it.

I recommend checking out Medium‘s breakdown on more of their videos and TheGrandNarrative‘s take on Ga-in’s “Bloom.” Seoulbeats does a deep dive on Brown Eyed Girl’s “Cleansing Cream,” which is phenomenal.On the shore of the East River in Brooklyn Bridge Park, a tangle of aluminum coils rests like a tangled 50ft slinky. The massive loops form a porous cave against the light Tuesday morning rain – people pose for pictures at the edges, while a toddler steps over the square tubes in tiny Ugg boots. The hulking aluminum tumbleweed, likely to be stumbled upon by joggers on an evening run, is New York Clearing, a piece by the renowned British sculptor Antony Gormley and a local art experiment supported by one of the biggest boybands in the world.

Connect, BTS, is a global arts project led by BTS, the seven-member South Korean pop sensation, now one of the world’s most popular music acts. Interested in a different avenue to connect people, BTS has sponsored sites in London, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Berlin and New York featuring interactive work from 22 artists. Connect BTS, which will unveil elements of the project over the course of this year, shares with the band, according to its curator Daehyung Lee in a press release, “a deliberate porousness, and a realization of the possibility of seeing the world differently”.

Based on a series housed at the Royal Academy in London, Gormley’s New York Clearing features the same looping, buoyant coils – a scribble come to life by a single line of over 11 miles of aluminum tubing tied and welded together without beginning or end. It’s also the first of Gormley’s Clearing projects to be staged outside, unbounded by museum admission. The potential to reach new audiences, either in New York or through BTS’s massive fanbase, initially drew Gromley, who’s perhaps best known for his 66ft (20-meter) Angel of the North figure in Gateshead, to the project. “I felt from the very beginning [Connect, BTS] was an act of hope,” he told the Guardian. He admired the group’s sense that much of their fanbase, mainly Generation Z, thinks the world is on fire – the planet is warming, social media can divide and poison as much as it connects – yet the band and Lee’s mission to channel a message through visual art to a larger, pop-based audience was “refreshingly idealistic”.

A superstar band, with its massive commercial appeal, and the rarefied visual art world may seem like an unlikely collaboration, but BTS is “trying to tell their personal truth and make it universal, and in that sense then we’re in the same field”, Gormley said. Still, “the art world is relatively insular and self-serving … and these young guys come along with their millions of followers and offer a bridge for a whole new kind of audience – how could you refuse that?”

Gormley said he admired both Lee and the band’s aspirations of connectivity and re-engaging with one’s immediate, sensory environment. “It’s a different industry, different methodology, but we are envisioning the same future to be shared with the entire humanity, all together,” Lee told the Guardian. “This is our final chapter and culmination of the Connect, BTS project,” he said in a speech welcoming visitors to New York Clearing on Tuesday, “but I wish this is the beginning of our collective initiative to awaken our forgotten sensorium, to value diversity, to understand different people around the world.”

Part of the project’s mission (or, as Gormley called it, “experiment”) is to redirect attention back to the tactile and analog. “Because of our goal-orientated consciousness, we tend to ignore a lot of the signals that are coming toward us,” Gormley said, in a message that sounds straight out of the bestseller How To Do Nothing or the many books touting disconnection from one’s phone to reconnect with the environment around you. “Our bodies are extraordinarily acute instruments that are telling us things about our environment all the time, but we tend to ignore all of that because we’re basically concentrating on our screens.”

In New York Clearing, assembled in the cold over the course of a couple weeks, you have to step over coils, duck under loops, reassess your path. Engagement with the piece produces a circular sensation, observing other people observing you observe the environment; when I pressed lightly on an unbundled coil, I could see it wriggle under someone else’s hand across the sculpture. “We have body empathy, that’s maybe the most powerful communication of all,” said Gormley, “the viewer becoming the viewed for other viewers, but more importantly, the viewer being the subject in the ground. It’s the ground the artist is providing you, not a picture, not a representation.”

Instead, New York Clearing, he said, is “simply an invitation and a question, which is: come and see what it feels like in this thing that isn’t really an object – it’s more of a place, it’s more of a phenomenon. It’s an environment that you can become part of.” Do you step into the drawing, or examine from afar? How do you see yourself in the space? How are you feeling, in this light, in this time, in this place? “I like the idea that if you accept the invitation, come in and see how it feels,” said Gormley. 



He pointed to the lower Manhattan skyline, a fixed vertical grid looming over the unbridled Clearing scene – “here is the condition, the contemporary urban condition, but here is potential, here is energy as an open possibility.”

Read below as we retrace the same moments and try to decipher as to what really happened between the two K pop idols.

To say that K-pop bands have taken over the world would be an understatement! There's a sense of charm attached to the male and female K-pop idols that set them apart from the rest. Given their loyal fan culture, bands like BTS and TWICE have an enthusiastic amount of fame and fortune. But with mega-stardom, there are flaws as well! Idols like to keep their private lives away from the spotlight and focus more on their music, but there's a section of their respective fandoms who go the extra mile and want to know - EVERYTHING!

Case in point, we have popular BTS and TWICE members Jimin and Jeongyeon! Between ARMY and ONCE, there have been heated discussions in the past as to what really went down between Jimin and Jeongyeon and whether something actually happened in the first place. If you go across social media platforms and YouTube, you'll find many fan evaluations of their 'hidden' beef, which is supposedly apparent during public appearances. One viral moment happened at Music Bank where BTS and TWICE were being interviewed in the same room. The Bangtan Boys started singing their hit song Spring Day with TWICE joining along. However, it was in the end when Jeongyeon sang loudly and got the weirdest look from Chim Chim.

In case you wanted all the visual proof, watch the fan-made video of Jimin and Jeongyeon moments below:

This had Twitterati wondering if there was a real beef between the two, even though neither has publicly addressed the fan-made rivalry. Then, during a VLive session, when the rest of the nonet were dancing along to BTS songs, Jeongyeon seemed thoroughly uncomfortable and even stepped away from the cameras. Even Nayeon points at her laughing about something mischevious, which had ONCE and ARMY deciphering the meaning again.

While backstage during Music Core, Jeongyeon had an expression that could rival Jimin's Music Bank expression when Jimin, the MC at the time, appeared next to them on a television screen going over the top yet adorable with his act. On SBS Inkigayo, when Jeongyeon was MC, along with her sister Seungyeon, were joined on stage by BTS, the TWICE member started mimicking the septet and got a major laugh out of Jimin.

At the 2016 Idol Star Athletics Ssireum Futsal Archery Championships, taking a u-turn in their supposed heat, there were several cutesy moments between Jimin and Jeongyeon as they saw each other quite a many times and even shared sweet smiles.

Check out recent tweets by ARMY and ONCE regarding Jimin vs. Jeongyeon below:

Many assume that the two had a relationship prior to their debuts and things fell out on a bad note. Some feel it could be more of a 'sibling' rivalry between the two while some think that it's just plain hatred, with absolutely no reason attached.

Unless we hear it from the horse's mouth, ARMY and ONCE will continue to be left baffled over the question - What really happened between Jimin and Jeongyeon?Amber Liu left f (x) after 10 years in the K-pop group. The songs on her new EP, X represent watershed moments in her life. Photo: HandoutBTS’s new single “Black Swan” may have come and gone on many Billboard charts after making a splashy debut last week, but an older cut is still holding on. In fact, it’s doing better than ever, and now it’s become one of the biggest successes in K-pop history on one important ranking.

The Korean band’s 2019 release “Make It Right” rises to No. 24 on this week’s Pop Songs chart, a new high point for the track. The single, which now features Lauv, has been living on the tally for some time, and it’s only performing better and better as the frames pass.

“Make It Right” now stands as the third-highest-charting K-pop single in the history of the Pop Songs chart, which ranks the most-played tunes on mainstream top 40/pop radio stations across the U.S. every week.

Leading the way among all Korean-language tracks that have made it to the Pop Songs chart is Psy’s “Gangnam Style,” which remains the only K-pop release to break into the top 10. It peaked at No. 10 back in 2012, becoming a historic win for the genre.

BTS and Halsey’s “Boy with Luv” holds the title of the second-highest-charting K-pop single in Pop Songs history, as it lifted as high as No. 22 last year. With any luck, the band may rewrite their own best showing, if “Make It Right” can continue to climb as it earns more love from radio stations around the nation.

Last week, “Make It Right” was tied as the fourth-highest-charting K-pop cut on the Pop Songs tally, but now it’s not only broken out of that tie, but blown past another big win from the same band. Monsta X and French Montana’s “Who Do U Love?” was on the same level as BTS and Lauv’s longstanding hit, as they had both peaked at No. 26. Now, “Make It Right” has advanced, passing that tune and leapfrogging over another one of their singles, “Mic Drop” with Steve Aoki and Desiigner, which stalled at No. 25 in 2017.

“Mic Drop” has now been pushed down to fourth place on the ranking of the K-pop singles that have risen the highest on the Pop Songs chart, while “Who Do U Love?” slips to fifth on that same tally.From South Korea to the United States and back again: Bobby went from singing in a church choir to rapping as part of K-pop boy group iKon.To really understand the popularity of the K-pop group Monsta X, you just have to listen.

Friday, you heard it in the screams of hundreds of sleep-deprived fans who packed the legendary Roxy Nightclub in Hollywood for a private Monsta X performance, and then snaked a line down four blocks of Sunset Boulevard for a chance to meet Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, and I.M. at a Monsta X pop-up shop in the former Tower Records building (the sixth member, Joohoney, was out sick).

After a brief Q&A at the Roxy — key takeaways: I.M. wants to learn Spanish; Minhyuk hates cucumbers; and Kihyun’s parents still scold him for spending too much money — the group performed a couple tracks from their new album, ALL ABOUT LUV, before a cavalcade of Jaguar convertibles (and a police escort) drove them down the aforementioned four blocks for a meet-and-greet at the Tower Records pop-up.

The Roxy show and pop-up shop was the kickoff to what will hopefully be a big year for Monsta X, who have an ambitious promo plan in place in support of ALL ABOUT LUV, which hit stores and streaming services, fittingly, on Valentine’s Day last week. The group’s sixth studio album, ALL ABOUT LUV (via Epic Records) marks the first all-English language release by a K-pop group since JYJ’s The Beginning in 2010. It’s also the first release from Monsta X since the group became a six-piece, following the departure of founding member, Wonho, last fall.

Listen, to the bouncy first single, “Who Do U Love?” which features French Montana and the catchiest chorus since Bieber and Sheeran’s “I Don’t Care.” First released last summer, the song has amassed more than 47 million streams online and 31 million views for the official music video on YouTube.

Another track that bridges boundaries: the Pitbull-featuring “Beside U,” which features writing and producer credits from Mr. 305 along with one Timothy Mosley, a.k.a. Timbaland.

No matter where you are tonight, I’ma fly ’round the whole world to find you

No matter where you are tonight, I’ma make sure I end up beside you.

The tight, 11-track offering spans pop, hip-hop and dance (“All Time Low” singer Jon Bellion and will.i.am are among the contributors), though Monsta X’s harmonies and laidback vocal stylings have more in common with One Direction or BSB, than that other three-letter group. As the first English album from an Asian group in almost a decade, ALL ABOUT LUV also stands out for its broader, more universal appeal.

“We always try to think of a better way to deliver our messages to fans who don’t understand Korean,” explains Kihyun, the main vocalist in the group. “As English is a universal language, we took advantage of our English album and tried to deliver messages that we want to give back to our fans. We want to give back the enormous love and support we had from them; they mean everything to us.”

“Sound-wise, this album is quite different from our Korean albums,” adds I.M., the lead rapper and youngest member of the group. “It is more pop as opposed to our Korean albums, which have a harder beat, K-pop vibe.”

As proof, Shownu, the leader of the group, cites “comethru” singer Jeremy Zucker as inspiration, while Hyungwon shouts out Justin Bieber, whose new album came out on the same day as ALL ABOUT LUV. “He’s very popular all around the world including Korea and I personally like his music very much,” Hyungwon says.

Celebrating their fifth anniversary together this spring (the group was formed through a Making the Band-style reality show in Korea and debuted in 2015), Monsta X is also tackling more mature subject matter on the album, with frequent references to hook ups, drinking and relationships — three topics that are rarely broached by the typically clean-cut K-pop set. The guys share writing credits on a number of the tracks as well.

“As the album title, ALL ABOUT LUV implies, every track of this album talks about different stories of love,” offers I.M.

Hyungwon, the lead dancer of the group, is more direct: “We would love for our fans to feel the romantic and sexual vibe of us after listening to our album,” he says, “which is something they haven’t felt from our previous albums.”

Listen to the toe-tapping, “Love U,” with lyrics like You make me crazy, it’s not just the wine / Go on and take me right across the line / Looking at you, I got one thing on my mind.

Listen to “Middle of the Night,” which chugs along with a Drake-lite beat produced by Ali Payami, who’s worked with Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and The Weeknd. The chorus finds Monsta X yearning for a not-so-discreet, late-night rendezvous.

And I’ll be on the way in the middle of night

‘Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise

We’re kissing in the car underneath of the night

The most overt references come in the slow-burning ballad, “Misbehave.” I love it when we misbehave, they say that we got issues, but girl, that’s why I’m with you / Love it when we mess this up, every time we argue, straight into the bedroom. This is baby-making music, Monsta X-style.

This summer, Monsta X hits the road for a six-week North American headlining tour, playing arenas coast-to-coast. The tour kicks off June 2nd in Minneapolis before ending in Los Angeles at The Forum on July 11th. (While the group’s “We Are Here” world tour hit up nine U.S. cities last year — along with performances at the Teen Choice Awards and iHeartRadio Music Festival — this year’s tour is set to be their largest one yet, doubling up on both venue size and the number of places they’re visiting.)

The pop landscape continues to change, and while a number of K-pop acts have tried to break the North American market, the guys in Monsta X say they’ve done their homework and are prepared to make their mark.

“I think we try to approach our fans from various perspectives,” explains Kihyun. “Our music comprises genres like hip-hop, rock, ballads, jazz, pop, EDM, etc. We also release music in Korean, English [and] even in Japanese with different sounds and vibes,” he says. “Variety and diversity are our key identities.”

“Still,” adds Minhyuk, “We believe good music is a universal language and it works the same anywhere around the world.”

All they need now, is for people to start listening.As the movie industry continues to reverberate from the recent international success of Bong Joon-ho’s triumphant Oscar-winning movie Parasite, it seems that Bong has offered up an unsanitised version of Korea, one that may shock many followers of K-pop, which promotes a scintillating and polished image of South Korea.

BTS, global superstars that they have become, allow their young fans to follow their ‘K-wave Dream’, one that could mislead them into thinking that all is squeaky clean in South Korea.

The images of poverty and desperation in South Korea have remained far from the well-choreographed, glossy pop videos of K-pop, and to a large degree, K-dramas, which have become increasingly more popular thanks to Netflix, where the Korean offerings surpass those, not only of China and Japan, but also of France and other foreign language markets.

Bong’s latest work, like most of his others, draws our attention to the social reality and the gaping divide between the rich and poor in South Korea, as we now enter the second decade of the twenty-first century.

This does, nevertheless, call for a moment of reflection to consider how Korea has changed from a century ago when its culture and identity were threatened under the repression of Japanese colonial rule. Korean culture now rocks the world, literally and metaphorically.

But, K-pop’s image has taken quite the battering over the past year considering the disgraceful fall of Big Bang’s Seungri, linked to a prostitution ring along with other male celebrities involved in the Burning Sun nightclub scandal.

Maybe even more serious, has been the unfortunate number of tragic celebrity suicides, particularly K-pop stars, reflecting the growing problem of mental health and anxiety, heightened by social media and an ever-growing intrusive press with unrealistic expectations for young celebrities.

BTS have collectively drawn attention to issues related to mental health and have spoken of the need to open up and talk about them, carving out for themselves a pop image that is socially conscientious and that is important for their young fans, who may also face depression themselves due to stressful matters in their own lives.

Bong Joon-ho’s carefully crafted movies (Memories of Murder and Mother, for example) dare to highlight the sometimes troublesome and complicated harsh realities of modern life and present us with un-photoshopped Korean reality, in a sometimes abrupt manner, just as they also call for change.

His criticisms of government and police corruption, recurring themes in his impressive body of widely acclaimed work, led to his name being blacklisted with many others during the presidency of Lee Myung-bak and the failed ‘corrupt’ presidency of Park Geun-hye, herself daughter of the corrupt military dictator Park Chung-hee (1961-78).

These intersecting worlds reflect the complicated lives facing South Koreans, both young and old, in a diverse society that is rapidly changing, with some getting much richer, but more, being left behind, forced to deal with a reality that is not always so kind.

Contributing writer Kevin N. Cawley is Director of Korean studies at University College Cork, Ireland. He is also an author of “Religious and Philosophical Traditions of Korea,” which was published in 2019 by Routledge.Samsung announced that it has signed a partnership with K-pop royalty BTS, according to a Yonhap News Agency report.

The company will start by collaborating with BTS for the group's global contemporary art initiative Connect BTS, which was designed to create art projects involving the group's philosophy for love and diversity in five cities namely London, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul and New York.

Samsung will reportedly support the augmented reality (AR) aspects of the initiative, where BTS members are said to appear and talk to fans about the art pieces in a virtual setting.

"We hope we can deliver a good experience to fans of BTS and Galaxy devices around the globe through collaboration with BTS. We are planning various activities other than Connect BTS," a Samsung official said in the Yonhap report.

While the company did not share any other details about the BTS partnership, the report stated that industry experts believe the group will join Samsung's promotion and marketing events for the newly-launched Galaxy S20 flagship series.

Website All-Kpop reported that some eagle-eyed fans at the Galaxy Unpacked event in the United States spotted BTS member V (real name Kim Tae-hyung) in a promotional video for the Galaxy S20 smartphone.

The news also made Samsung a trending topic on Twitter today (Feb 19) with more than 100,000 tweets and counting, especially among the huge BTS Army (what the fans call themselves) fanbase.

For example, one BTS Army Twitter account based in South Korea has around 4.2 million followers. BTS' verified Twitter account itself has 24 million followers.

Fans speculated that Samsung may release special edition BTS-themed mobile devices and wearables, just like the company did with current brand ambassadors K-pop girl group Blackpink.

Fans EXO dikejutkan dengan berita dari idola kesayangan mereka.'Why is he wearing a Celtic top?' - Fans react to K-Pop band Stray Kids wearing iconic shirts in music video

Celtic fans have reacted with a mixture of bemusement and disbelief after discovering not one but two Hoops shirts featuring in a music video by popular South Korean band Stray Kids.

The nine-piece boyband, based in Seoul, have been active since 2017 and are well-known for tracks such as Miroh and Double Knot, which both made the Billboard top five last year.

The video featuring the Celtic shirts is for My Pace, which reached number 8 in the Billboard charts in 2018 and has garnered 75 million views on YouTube.

Along with retro England and Real Madrid shirts, Celtic's 1998/99 away kit and NTL-sponsored home shirt worn between 2001 and 2003 are visible in the video.

Supporters reacted on social media with one quipping: "K'rean Brigade" while another added: "[The] only K-Pop video I will ever appreciate!"

Another wrote: "OK so I have questions, who is this and why are they wearing a Celtic top?"

The Parkhead club have had two South Korean players in the last 20 years - defender Cha Du-ri, who played more than 40 games for Celtic during the 2010/11 and 2011/12 campaigns, and Gwangju-born midfielder Ki Sung-yeung, who made 87 appearances between 2009 and 2012.

Perhaps shedding light on why the singers had chosen to wear Celtic shirts, Stevie O'Farrell said: "In 2013 I worked in South Korea for a year. Used to wear a Celtic top sometimes in Ulsan downtown and kids used to stop and talk, take photos. Cha Du-ri was the reason. They love the Celtic."

Celebrities wearing Celtic shirts is hardly a new phenomenon - in October last year, New York Mets shortstop Amed Rosario gave a TV interview while wearing the grey and pink change strip. Rapper Snoop Dogg has been known to wear one, fellow hip hop superstar Coolio actually turned up to Celtic Park on one occasion and 24 actor Kiefer Sutherland was seen wearing a 2014/15 shirt on set.Time to practise your Sorry, Sorry moves, K-pop fans, because Super Junior, is coming to Kuala Lumpur next month!

The legendary boy band is making their return to Malaysia with a full concert on March 1,5pm, at the Aziata Arena, Bukit Jalil, KL, which is part of its Super Junior World Tour – Super Show 8: Infinite Time tour.

Formed in 2005, Super Junior was one of the first K-pop male groups to breakthrough on the international scene, thanks in part to its 2009 mega-hit Sorry, Sorry, which also launched a global dance craze. They also scored big hits with Mr. Simple, Sexy, Free & Single, MAMACITA, Black Suit, Lo Siento, among others.

Currently comprising eight members (Leeteuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun, Shindong, Yesung and Eunhyuk), Super Junior fully reformed for the first time in nine years last year after its youngest member, Kyuhyun, completed his two-year mandatory military service last May. Super Junior released its latest and ninth full-length album last month – Timeless, which is the finale of the band's time-themed album trilogy (which includes Time Slip, released in October and Time Line released in November).

Which celebrity do you share your MBTI with? Let us know in the comments below!K-pop star, singer and actor Henry Lau lends his voice to a global musical collaboration with world renowned EDM pioneers Far East Movement and the London electro-pop duo AlunaGeorge.

The song, titled Nice Things, focuses on the end of a relationship and plays on the saying, “This is why we can’t have nice things,” which usually assigns blame to someone else for what went wrong. In this case, it’s love gone wrong.

“Love is polarizing and love is sacrifice,” said Prohgress, a member of Far East Movement. “And love is best when it drives you crazy. This song is one of those movies.”

The track was produced by Far East Movement’s label Transparent Arts, which partners with China’s streaming service NetEase to create songs that blend artists from different cultures and languages.

Lau, commonly referred to as just Henry, is a Canadian singer-songwriter, composer, actor, entertainer and music producer mostly active in South Korea and China. Although he debuted as a member of the k-pop group Super Junior-M, he went on to have a successful solo career, with songs such as Trap and musical contributions to the soundtrack of dramas such as While You Were Sleeping. Henry appeared in a few Korean dramas, including My Sweet City, Persevere Goo Hae-ra and Oh My Venus. In 2019, he made his Hollywood debut in the film A Dog's Journey, the sequel to the 2017 film A Dog's Purpose.

It’s Henry’s first collaboration with Far East Movement. Known for fusing electronic, pop and hip-hop genres, Far East Movement were the first Asian-American artists to hit #1 on the Billboard Charts. Their ever growing catalog of music—including Rocketeer, Girls On The Dance Floor, If I Was You (OMG)—has been supported by artists such as Skrillex, Diplo, and Afrojack. They’ve also opened for Lady Gaga, Robyn, Rihanna and collaborated with Feist.

Their album, Dirty Bass, spawned four singles that reached the top 10 of pop charts across the globe: Turn Up The Love, Live My Life, Dirty Bass, and The Illest. The group’s latest album, Identity, which explores their Asian and American identities, landed on top of the iTunes US Dance and Billboard Dance charts.

AlunaGeorge is an English electronic music duo, consisting of singer-songwriter Aluna Francis and producer George Reid. AlunaGeorge is best known for the songs You Know You Like It and Your Drums, Your Love, with the latter debuting at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart.

“We like to mix up our sound with artists from different genres,” said Kev Nish of Far East Movement. “With our Identity album, our single Freal Luv with Marshmello, Chanyeol and Tinashe gave us the first real chance to try a culturally global collaboration. That experience was really fulfilling for us. Growing up both Asian and American, blending these styles matched with our identity as artists from both these cultures.”

Nice Things is the first Far East Movement and NetEase collaboration of 2020 following multi-cultural collaborations in 2019 that produced five Top 5 hits on the NetEase Cloud Music streaming charts. Their 2019 songs include Bamboo featuring Chinese pop sensation Jason Khang and Asian-American songstress Kina Grannis, Blossoms featuring Atlanta soul artist Troop Brand and Chinese rapper Vava, Paint The Clouds featuring Chinese singer Tia Ray, Maps featuring Diamond, Starchild Yeezo and hip-hop/trap producer Rell The Soundbender, and #1 hit Lovebird featuring award-winning Chinese singer/songwriter and EXO member Lay.Other than the fans, they were also met by GMA-7 reporter Marisol Abdurahman, who was criticized for attempting to do an ambush interview with the group as they boarded their transport out of the airport.Social 50 est un classement dressé selon l'influence sur Internet et basé sur le nombre d'abonnés sur les réseaux sociaux comme Facebook, Twitter et YouTube, la fréquence des mentions et le nombre de consultations sur l'artiste ou le groupe, mesurés et analysés par Next Big Sound.India-Republic of Korea (RoK) relations have made rapid strides in recent years. While it may have taken New Delhi and Seoul many decades to reinvigorate their relationship, the two are today in the midst of a multidimensional and transformative tie, especially under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Moon Jae-in.[1] Modi’s Act East Policy (AEP) and Moon Jae-in’s New Southern Policy (NSP)—which gives primacy to the acceleration of RoK’s economic and strategic relations with India—both have led to a convergence of interests and energies between the two countries. This has had a visible impact on the widening of bilateral trade and commerce, apart from the alignment of their strategic interests in the Northeast Asian region. Less attention, however, has been given to other developments with regard to political, cultural and people-to-people relations that have deepened over the last few years. Indeed, with no unpleasant historical memories between them nor geopolitical rivalries, there is limitless potential in this critical relationship.

It may be recalled that India played a crucial and positive role in Korean affairs soon after the latter’s independence in 1945. India’s K P S Menon served as Chairman of the nine-member United Nations (UN) Commission that was set up in 1947 to oversee elections in Korea. During the Korean War (1950-53), the warring sides accepted a UN resolution sponsored by India calling for a ceasefire; one was declared on 27 July 1953. The relationship, however, would remain dormant for many decades for various reasons, and it was only in 1962 that the two countries established consular relations. This was then upgraded to Ambassador-level in 1973. This development caused a little impact on trade and commercial relations, let alone political and people-to-people relations. Even then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao’s much talked about Look East Policy (LEP) in the 1990s failed to make any visible traction in India-RoK relations.

An important visit by then Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam at a critical juncture to Seoul in February 2006 opened the door for a more vibrant phase in India-RoK relations. It resulted in the launching of a Joint Task Force to conclude a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which was operationalised on 1 January 2010. President Lee paid a landmark visit to India as Chief Guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations on 26 January 2010. It was then that the bilateral ties were raised to the level of Strategic Partnership.[2] This was quickly followed by President Pratibha Patil’s State Visit in July 2011 where both countries signed a Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation Agreement. This received further boost during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s official visit to Seoul in March 2012, not only for the Nuclear Security Summit but to discuss bilateral relations as well.

FurtherIn January 2014, South Korean President Park Geun-hye conducted a state visit to India. The “Joint Statement for Expansion of Strategic Partnership” that was issued during this visit produced a blueprint for further expanding the two countries’ relations in the political, security, defence, economic, scientific & technological, and IT spheres. Equally importantly, the visit focused on cultural and people-to-people relations.

The watershed in the bilateral relations came during the tenure of both countries’ current leaders, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Soon after assuming the mantle in 2014, Prime Minister Modi unveiled a new policy called ‘Act East’[3] signaling the government’s strong commitment to deepen relations with countries in the Indo-Pacific region such as Japan and RoK. As a followup, Prime Minister Modi paid a state visit to South Korea within the first year of his government, in May 2015. During this eventful state visit, India-RoK bilateral relations was upgraded to ‘special strategic partnership’. In the ‘Joint Statement for Special Strategic Partnership’, the two leaders agreed to establish a 2+2 consultation mechanism at the level of the Secretary/Vice Minister of Foreign Office and Defense Ministry.

In 2017, President Moon took over the South Korean presidency, and the country’s relationship with India soon witnessed much greater traction. President Moon immediately made his pro-India stance clear by sending Chung Dongchea, former culture minister, as his special envoy to India; it was the first such instance in the bilateral relationship. He later took the crucial decision of upgrading the relationship equivalent to four traditional partners under the “New Asia Community Plus” framework[4].

In parallel, India’s then Finance and Defense Minister Arun Jaitely (now deceased) visited South Korea in June 2017 during which the two countries concluded talks on the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF), signed an MoU between their EXIM banks, and reviewed ongoing defence relationship. This was followed by a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of G-20 Summit in Hamburg in early July 2017.

Giving a further fillip to the relationship, President Moon made a four-day state visit to India in July 2018. South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s recent visit to India from July 8-11 was landmark in providing a new impetus to India-South Korea relations. This was Moon’s first official visit to India and he took this visit in pursuance of his new southward strategy that sought to follow a balanced diplomacy by strengthening RoK’s relations with ASEAN countries, including India.

In other words, President Moon’s visit came at a critical juncture in which India-South Korea relations have matured. Some 46 years since the two countries established diplomatic relations, their ties especially in the last decade or so have grown robust and multi-dimensional, encompassing a wide range of interests including nuclear disarmament, maritime security, regional economic cooperation, counterterrorism, and energy cooperation.[5]

One of the critical but largely unseen developments in the recent decades is the gradual recognition of deeper historical and civilisational bonds between the two friendly nations. Indeed, India and RoK relations have a deep civilisational link dating back to several centuries. The spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia in the 4th century formed a direct connection between India and South Korea, and since then has continued to remain a critical reference point. What many may not be aware of is that there is a much deeper cultural bond between the two nations: A significant Korean consciousness relates to the legend of the marriage of the Korean King Suro with Suriratna, princesses from Ayodhya, the sacred birthplace of Hindu God Lord Rama.[6]

With these critical openings, a huge surge has begun in the last few decades in terms of expanding and cementing cultural ties between these two ancient civilisations. The cultural ties have been institutionalised via the establishment of an Indian Cultural Centre (ICC) in Seoul in April 2011. Another culture centre was established in Busan in December 2013 through the public-private-partnership mode. Earlier, in May 2011, a bust of Nobel Laureate and famous Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore was unveiled in Daehangro, Seoul.

Even further, both countries have a taken series of important decisions to boost people-to-people relations in terms of improving travel between the two countries. For instance, India extended a visa-on-arrival (VoA) facility for South Korean tourists beginning 15 April 2014. As a gesture of friendship and goodwill to the South Korean people, the Prime Minister of India gifted South Korea a sapling of the sacred Bodhi tree under which the Lord Buddha had attained enlightenment. Similarly, a bust of Mahatma Gandhi, presented by ICCR, was unveiled at the Hongbeop-sa temple in Busan on 21 July 2014. Further, ICC in Seoul and Busan offers regular classes on yoga and dance, both contemporary and classical for promotion of Indian culture. Classes on Hindi, tabla and cooking have also been started with local teachers as part of outreach activities. Lectures, exhibitions and performances are arranged periodically by ICC. An annual festival of India in South Korea titled SARANG was initiated in 2015 and held in 2016, showcasing the diversity of Indian culture and art forms in various parts of South Korea.[7]

In the last few years a number of institutional arrangements and agreements have been signed between organisations and academic entities to further people-to-people exchanges. This included an MoU between India’s Foreign Services Institute (FSI) and the Korea National Diplomatic Academy (KNDA) signed in March 2012, and India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) various MoUs with Yonsei University, Korea University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) and Busan University of Foreign Studies. The Delhi University (DU) has also signed a MoU with Korea University. In addition, HUFS in Seoul, and Busan University of Foreign Studies have created their respective Indian Studies departments; for their part, JNU and DU offer programmes in Korea Studies and Korean Language courses, respectively. Madras University has also opened a Department of Korean Studies encouraged by the sizeable presence of Koreans in Tamil Nadu, including employees of Hyundai Motors and their families. Recently as well, the Central University of Jharkhand (CUJ) started offering five-year integrated postgraduate degrees in Korean language. Manipur University and Madras Christian College are offering Diploma courses in Korean Language.[8]

Similarly, in 2012 Seoul National University established a New Department of Asian Languages and 4 Civilizations which offers a degree in Indian Studies. Various other universities in South Korea are offering degree courses in Indian Philosophy, Yoga and Ayurveda. The Seoul Forum for International Affairs and the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations have been jointly organising the India-Korea Dialogue that makes recommendations on policies and practical measures to strengthen bilateral relations between the countries. Twenty rounds of dialogue have been held till date, with the last one in November 2016 in Seoul. The Ananta Aspen Centre will be coordinating the 16th round of dialogue from the Indian side, held in November 2017. The Institute for Indian Studies Korea (IISK) was established at Korea International Trade Association (KITA) on 3 December 2013, bringing together a large number of Korean academics, economists and business representatives. ‘India Fortune’ has been organising ‘India Advanced Management Programme’ for MPs, senior South Korean officials, and CEOs covering Indian economy, corporate environment, and Indian culture. The participants are taken to India on a familiarisation tour. In other words, a good beginning has been made in the past few years to foster and promote people-to-people exchanges and deepen awareness amongst various sections of both countries.

A critical development in recent years is improved air connectivity between the two countries. With Air India, Asiana Airlines and Korean Air operating direct flights at regular intervals, air travel has become more accessible to a bigger number of people. The bilateral civil aviation agreement of 1994 was revised in November 2015, increasing weekly flights between the two countries to 19; this resulted in new operations by Korean Airlines which started direct flights to Delhi. The number of visas issued by South Korea to Indian tourists has gone up dramatically, too.

Yet, there remains scope for much improvement in connectivity between the two countries. Testimony to this is the low number of Indians living in South Korea, estimated at 12,000, 120 of them PIOs. Nearly 1,000 Indian students are pursuing postgraduate and doctoral programmes, mostly in natural sciences in South Korea. However, this is minuscule compared to the number of Indian students who go to Australia and Singapore.

As discussed earlier, despite the many positive stories and the massive turn-around in ties, there remains immense potential in India-RoK relations particularly in the realms of cultural and institutional exchanges.

India under PM Modi has launched an ambitious initiative on sanitation called Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Clean India campaign. Launched with much fanfare in 2014, this campaign aims to stop open defecation and draw basic attention to sanitation and public health for development has caught global attention. For instance, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded Prime Minister Modi their highest award for swachh bharat. Although the initiative has emerged as a national awareness movement, it continues to struggle with a lack of resources. It is in this regard that the country can learn from the experience of South Korea, especially its Saemaul Undong or New Village Movement. Highlighting the possibility of experience sharing and learnings, a Korean scholar Soyen Park[9] has drawn the attention of Indian policymakers to study the evolution and positive lessons of the New Village Movement that was initiated by then-President Park Chung-hee in 1970. The New Village Movement encourages self-help and voluntarism for households and schools to clean up their neighbourhoods. The movement has had a huge impact on improving several sectors of the economy apart from rural health and livelihoods. While the Korean experiment was undertaken in different socio-economic contexts and may not exactly suit India conditions, Indian leadership and civil society can engage with academics and governmental institutions in Korea to learn from this initiative.

For years, Korean cuisine and TV serials have emerged as a key point of consumption among several states in India’s northeast. The popularity of Korean TV shows—and K-pop in particular—have grown in the last decade, albeit under curious circumstances. In the early 2000s, several insurgent groups in Nagaland and Manipur banned Hindi channels and Bollywood movies in the region. This gave the local people little choice but to turn to other viewing fares for entertainment, and Korean soap operas became an attractive choice.[10]

Beyond the Northeast, even Bollywood filmmakers themselves have grown increasingly fond of South Korean films. Popular movies produced in South Korea have been adapted and reproduced in Hindi cinemas and many of them became blockbusters winning awards and international recognition. For instance, Salman Khan-starrer, Bharat, was adapted from the 2014 Korean hit film, Ode to my Father.[11] Similarly, Korean hit, A Hard Day was made as OMG or Oh My God by director Umesh Shukla, which won many accolades. In 2015 alone, as many as nine Korean films were adapted in Hindi, some of them becoming the biggest grosser at the box office. Of course, this is not say the Bollywood films have no impact in Korean civic space. In fact, some movies like 3 Idiots by Amir Khan and My Name is Khan earned excellent reviews in Korea. Indian movies Stanley’s Tiffin Box, God’s Own Child and The Robot also earned critical acclaims in recent film festivals in Seoul.

Indeed, films, music, cuisines among other cultural affinities have a huge potential to drive and deepen people-to-people relations and can act as a bridge between India and South Korea. This needs more institutionalized attention.

One of the most unexplored areas of cooperation to strengthen the relationship between India and South Korea is democracy.[12] In Asia, India and South Korea, as democracies, share common values and have been seen above convergent interests in the region. As middle-power democracies in Asia where there are growing and the common threat from authoritarian non-democratic power, democracy building and cooperation can be a critical platform. The region, which is already experiencing the evolution of a democratic bloc in the name of Indo-Pacific quadrilateral involving India, Japan, Australia, and the US, needs the support of other middle powers such as Korea and Indonesia.

A key shortcoming on democracy in Asia is the lack of government-to-government cooperation on democracy building, governance cooperation, more so at the level of civil society. This is something that needs serious thinking and deliberation among the various stakeholders representing South Korea and India. There is a growing chorus for the middle-power democracies in Asia to play a larger role in strengthening and promoting liberal democratic values and a rules-based order.[13] South Korea has numerous think tanks and endowments specialising on democracy promotion and promoting liberal order in Indo-Pacific to steer this space. While India lacks institutional capacity and resources on this, it can take cues from RoK.

A steady decline of liberal democracies, the rapid rise of authoritarian regimes particularly China and the growing uncertainty over the continued support of advanced democracies especially the US, and a host of other factors have contributed to the rising relevance of non-western democracies or middle powers. India and Korea, with the possible inclusion of Japan, can fill this space. To defend the region from threats to liberal democracies, India and South Korea, along with other middle powers, can think of expanding cooperation in the following areas:
• Cooperation with like-minded countries in Asia to build capacities, technical/financial support on promoting and strengthening democratic governance
• Cooperation on fighting global issues/challenges: climate change, freedom of navigation, internet governance, and outer space
• Creation of a Security Order (i.e., Quad) to secure a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific
• More openness to think tanks/NGOs/networks of scholars/activists to create a critical mass
• Cooperation at the level of NGOs and think tanks – to build networks of think tanks and research organisations

In short, there is massive scope to expand ties between India and South Korea and make it a special relationship in Asia. What is needed is political will and new imagination in diverse areas such as cultural relations, building on people-to-people contacts, harnessing democracy and liberal values, and cementing civilisational connections. These, in turn, will depend on the strength of the bilateral economic and political relations.

The South Korean supergroup GOT7 has cancelled two concerts in Bangkok due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

Organisers 4NOLOGUE said the postponement of the “Keep Spinning” world tour dates scheduled for Feb 15 and 16 at Rajamangala National Stadium were for the safety of the artists and fans in light of global worries about the virus.

The decision had been reached after talks with their management, JYP Entertainment, in Seoul.

“4NOLOGUE is fully aware that all of the fans have been waiting and preparing everything to participate in the shows. However, the safety and health of the audiences and artists is our top priority,” the organisers said in a Facebook message, citing “coronavirus proliferation concerns”.

New dates for the concerts in the Thai capital have not been set.

The band also cancelled a Singapore show scheduled for Feb 22 for the same reasons.

Meanwhile, fans of K-pop queen Taeyeon are awaiting word on whether her shows scheduled for Feb 22 and 23 at Thunder Dome Muang Thong Thani will go ahead.

She postponed her concert in Singapore on Saturday, also because of concerns about the virus.

 Looking forward to: Won Bin‘s return to the small screen^That's Kang Hyun-gyu directing a promo video for A.C.E! He also creates/edits hilarious behind-the-scenes videos (he's directly credited onscreen, btw).

According to his CJ bio, he initially trained himself in underwater photography (which obviously came in handy for the submerged basement scenes) and then made the leap to film crew member.

We're truly blessed by his range of work!!! H/T SBS PopAsia.It has been a long way before Hallyu, and Korean culture dominates the international market, and thanks to the music genre, which is popularly known as Korean pop, it has become an excellent gateway to enter the mainstream throughout the globe.

In this regard, it is best to acknowledge the people behind the success of K-pop, who became the pioneer of the things that several K-pop fans were experiencing right now.

1. First K-pop Group and First K-pop Male Group SEO TAIJI AND BOYS

Seo Taiji and Boys have become the first group that molds South Korean pop music through the use of rap. The group debut in 1992, building a massive fandom that made their three albums to accumulate almost 2 million sold copies, three of the best-selling albums in South Korea. The group consists of Seo Taiji, Lee Juno, and Yang Hyunsuk, who is now one of the CEO of the Kpop Big 3 Agencies, YG Entertainment. The group lasts until 1996, but their legacy and influence still continue up until now.

Referred to as the "Fairies of K-pop," Sea, Eugene, and Shoo became the first-ever girl group of k-pop, which debuted under Sm Entertainment in 1997. Their success brought them a best-selling album in 2000, and the first group to do MV concepts, starting from a cutesy image to edgy performers.

After k-pop's success in South Korea, several agencies were built, and some of these were the most successful ones, including the Big 3: SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment. Fandoms were also created, and fans use to have a specific color of a balloon to cheer for their idols.

BigBang leader G-Dragon then thinks of something that will differentiate their fans, and at that moment, the first lightstick was created. Bangbong, which has the design of a crown, was designed by the "Kings of Kpop" GD himself, and YG was the first-ever company that makes mass production of K-pop lightsticks.

4. First Photocards in K-pop SNSD, and TVXQ

When buying an album, it always brings excitement to a fan to know what kind of photo card she will be going to have and who. However, did you know that photocards were not really a thing for the past years? Not until SM Entertainment created their first K-pop group photocard set for TVXQ, which was released in 2007, though it was released in Japan.

Meanwhile, Girls' Generation, who was the Nation's girl group, became the first group to release a photocard in Korea for their album "Oh!" revealed in 2010.

5. First K-pop Artist to Gain 1 Billion Views on Youtube PSY

One of the first solo artists who introduced K-pop in the mainstream with his song "Gangnam Style," the song becoming a worldwide sensation. PSY was also the first artist to have a music video with 1 Billion Views, not only for K-pop videos but among the videos on YouTube, recorded last 2012.'LOONA', known for being a multi-talented group with an important message to share, is back with their latest song 'So What'. And like their previous releases, the girl group makes a clear statement about being different and fearless.

Missing from this release is member Haseul who chose to take a step back from this comeback due to mental health-related issues. Earlier this year, it was reported that Haseul was receiving treatment for anxiety.

Another group that makes headlines for their message is ITZY. The group shot to fame with its debut song 'Dalla Dalla' (meaning 'different'), and later 'Icy' which, a lot like Mamamoo's 'HIP', is a message of self-love in the face of hate.

Speaking about Itzy's message member Yeji recently said, "For our debut song and what we’ve been promoting has been on the theme of self-love, but it’s not a narrow topic, it’s very broad and we can do a lot to explore that. I’d really like to delve deeper and explore that theme more."

But artists tackling self-love is not new. Artists singing about topics other than romantic love is also not new. So why would it be groundbreaking for young female artists to go down that path?

Historically, K-pop girl groups have rarely strayed from the tried-and-tested method of smile, look pretty, sing about boys — but never be seen with one. That would be far too scandalous.

As far as entertainment agencies were concerned, girls had only one thing on their minds - love. Specifically, a non-sexual love. They sang about love, they acted out love in music videos, and they talked about love in interviews, and they perfected the face a girl supposedly makes when her heart flutters at the sight of her crush. Basically, they were the embodiment of young, innocent love. But to be fair, that's also because the agencies weren't targeting female audiences with girl groups. No, that's what the boy groups were for.

Girl groups were not meant to inspire young girls. They were meant to create a fantasy for male audiences of K-pop. Agencies paraded groups upon groups of 'pure, young, fair-skinned women' who were charming and funny and respectful out on to stages much to the joy of their target audiences.

But there was always that one member in every girl group. You know, the one with the sharp wit and loudmouth, the tanned skin and a huge dose of sex appeal?

Hyori of Fin.K.L., Yuri of Girls Generation, Hyolyn of Sistar. Always that ONE girl.



Why that one girl, you ask? Well you see, that was the one girl who juxtaposed with the rest of the group, was designed to represent male fantasy and desire. She was the one that was outspoken and open-minded and had a sharp wit, that one that seemed to ooze a contemporary chic charm. The 'bad girl' who everyone loved. The 'bad girl' who everyone loved to hate.

And while the companies may not have planned for it, that one girl also happened to be the member that was often beloved by female fans. Turns out strong, opinionated, and free-spirited women were a hit among all audiences, even if they were still mostly singing about love.

So why are girl groups finally taking a stand? Why the sudden move away from love? Why the push for more empowering lyrics and concepts?

At the end of 2019, the K-pop world lost two of its most popular female idols, f(x)'s Sulli and Kara's Goo Hara to suicide. Both women were extremely vocal about their feminism and pro-LGBT stances. Sulli often spoke out about victims of sexual slavery and was a strong advocate for the no bra movement, and Hara came forward about the physical and sexual violence she endured at the hands of an ex-boyfriend. And both women dealt with a horrific amount of backlash that most see as contributing to their choice to end their lives.

Prior to her death, Hara was actively involved in the Burning Sun case, which rocked the industry and blew the lid open on the rape culture that exists in South Korea and how everyone from the police and government officials to entertainment company CEOs and male K-pop idols were complicit in and benefitted from the sexual assault of female idols.

The loss of the young stars shocked fans all over the world and added steam to the already burgeoning conversation around mental health in South Korea. But in addition, it shone a light on how the pressure of fame unfortunately also opens the doors to an onslaught of sexual violence, both verbal and physical against female idols in K-pop.

At a time when these conversations are gaining traction, young female idols putting out messages of self-love and empowerment speak volumes. These are voices that are sorely needed right now. The ones that tell young girls and women that it's okay to be different, to speak up about their traumatic experiences, and to support each other when they do.Self-love comes in many shapes and forms. The key to achieving it is to practice mindfulness, to accept that we are human, and to realize that we’re enough as such. Many idols without a doubt have addressed this matter many times in their songs and felt the need to emphasize the importance of self-love and how we perceive ourselves.

Here are seven K-pop songs that tackle the topic of self-love in depth.

In this moving ballad, Taeyeon reminisces about the hard times she once endured and writes her future self a letter filled with messages of liberation, self-love, and endless support. She also asks to be reminded of these words whenever she hits a rough patch and feels like hiding again.

SF9 goes above and beyond in this track to highlight the importance of accepting one’s beauty. Their lyrics boost confidence and charmingly compliment natural beauty, stating that we are beautiful just the way we are and that it’s enough.

Moonbyul and Seulgi join their voices to declare that selfishness is not always a bad thing. Instead of being a people-pleaser and being hard on yourself to meet others’ standards, you should be honest with yourself and make your own choices.

Nothing screams motivation like a fast-tempo track from Stray Kids! The group pinpoints that jealousy and comparison are meaningless and that only you can get your happiness by carrying on at your own pace. Remember, just because you rush things doesn’t mean you’ll reach your goals faster!

This piece of mind is brought to you by GOT7. Beyond what others think of you or how they expect you to behave, you must claim the freedom to be yourself in every possible way. Finding your true self and accepting it, your flaws included, is essential for self-love.

When was the last time you said no? CLC delivers a strong statement about speaking their minds and objecting to comments that don’t line up with their personal preferences. Staying true to ourselves no matter how much others try to mold us is a daily challenge that we learn to overcome with time.

Jin takes us on a journey of self-realization, where he makes a stop at all the red flags that keep one’s true self buried. He shares that our souls deserve to be nourished way before the same is done to others. He also insists to make peace with the fact that humans are lacking and to love oneself regardless.

 A concert producer has issued a new set of guidelines for three highly anticipated K-Pop concerts happening in Manila this month, while two other long-established festivals have been cancelled amid the escalating 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic around the world.

Following the Department of Health’s advisory to avoid crowded places in general, Happee Sy-Go of Pulp Live World announced that they will impose a “no mask, no entry” policy for the shows of South Korean boy group NCT Dream, SEVENTEEN and the cast of hit Korean variety show “Running Man.”

SEVENTEEN’s “Ode to You” concert is scheduled on February 8 at the Mall of Asia Arena (MoA) to be followed “Running Man’s” “A Decade of Laughter” tour in Manila on February 9 also at MoA. NCT Dream’s “The Dream” concert, meanwhile, has a show date on February 29 at the New Frontier Theater.

“We highly discourage those coming from [nCov] affected areas to [come to] the show for everyone’s safety… Body temperatures will also be checked [upon entry] and alcohol stations will be set up [around the venue].” Sy-Go said in a statement. These guidelines are in addition to the production’s strict rule of “no mask, no entry” for all patrons.

Meanwhile, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) regretfully cancelled its annual “Pasinaya” festival, which was initially slated from February 7 to 9. The event is noted for bringing the arts closer to the masses around this time each year.

“For the past 15 years, the CCP Open House Festival has been drawing thousands of spectators who can see-all-they-want for a suggested minimum donation of P50. Last year, more than 16,000 people participated in the country’s biggest multi-arts festival,” stated CCP artistic director Chris Millado.

“As the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus as a public health emergency of international concern, we urge the Filipino people not to panic and remain calm. Let us work together to prevent the virus from spreading. Let us remain vigilant and keep safe,” Millado added.

Even Baguio’s local government cancelled the opening of the world famous Panagbenga Festival, whic was supposed to hold its opening activities on January 31 and February 1. All big public activities in Baguio were likewise called off including the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Games on February 15 and the street events every Sunday on Session Road.

Mayor Benjamin Magalong noted they will still need to assess if the city will push through with the Panagbenga street and float parades on February 29 and March 1.

“The tourism revenues are the least of my concerns. My main priorities are the health of my constituents,” Magalong in a statement.

The series of announcements came soon after Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd confirmed on January 30 the country’s first case of nCoV, compounded Sunday by the first recorded nCov death outside China here in Manila. IZA IGLESIASJungkook is just one of seven members of the K-Pop band BTS, so how old is he, what's his net worth, and what do all his tattoos mean? We've got it all here!

BTS have just dropped their seventh album, Map Of The Soul:7, and will be heading out on a mammoth world tour this year, so as the boys are officially back on the scene, let's take a closer look at one of it's most loved members, Jungkook, his role in the band, net worth, and tats, we have it all!

Jungkook is a singer, songwriter and record producer and 1/7 of the biggest band in the world and K-Pop superstar, BTS. His role in the band is as a main vocalist, as well as a dancer (as they all are) and at 22 years old is the youngest member of the group.

What do Jungkook's tattoos mean?

After the band's break in 2019 when Jungkook returned onto the scene, fans noticed his fans were covered in ink- and when it didn't disappear, quickly realised he'd had some permanent tattoos done.

With 'army' written across his knuckles, the name of their fandom, as well as the letter 'J', a love heart, and has reportedly added even further to the collection with a skeleton and Nirvana lyrics that read 'Stay Away.'

What is Jungkook and BTS's net worth?

The band have been around since 2012, have seven albums worth of music and constantly sell out stadiums in minutes around the world, so unsurprisingly, they've made some serious cash.

Celebrity Net Worth puts the individual members net worths at £6 million, and it's reported he and his bandmates splashed out millions on a pad in the most expensive apartment complex in Seoul that they all share together.

This makes them the richest K-Pop band in South Korea, and despite this eye watering wealth, they remain seriously humble and down to earth!

If you were wondering how close the boys are, the fact they all live together probably hints at it!

The BTS boys don't have individual Instagram accounts (that we know of), but have a group account with over 22 million followers, that shows them in rehearsals, on stage, or messing around backstage, and it keeps us BTS fans fed!

Jungkook and the band have just dropped their seventh album, titled 'Map Of The Soul' boasting a whopping 20 tracks, one of which features Sia, and the boys are set to head out on a world tour

> Download Our App For All The Latest BTS NewsThe Billboard-chart-topping act is aiming worldwide with their new music to 'present the next level of K-pop.'

With No. 1s across Korea, Japan, the Billboard charts and beyond, TWICE is already one of K-pop's international leaders and now the girl group is looking even more worldwide with one of the biggest U.S. labels helping them.

Billboard can exclusively reveal the first details between a new strategic partnership between Korean superlabel JYP Entertainment and the top label on Billboard's 2019 year-end charts Republic Records.

While JYP is home to several beloved K-pop stars -- including singer-producer J.Y. Park who is also the company's namesake, fellow girl group ITZY, boy bands 2PM, GOT7 and Stray Kids, K-pop/rock outfit DAY6 and more -- TWICE will be first artist to be powered under the alliance.It appears that the K-Pop band BTS, currently one of the most popular bands in the world, has used an audio sample of Twitch streamer Greekgodx in one of its songs without the streamer's permission. It's a pretty big allegation for the group, which could lead to a legal battle depending on how both parties choose to proceed.

In one of BTS' new songs, "UGH!," someone can be heard screaming "let's go!" In a recent clip posted to Twitch, Greekgodx compared that to some of his own work, with the two voice clips being pretty much identical. If BTS is, in fact, using Greekgodx's voice without his permission, it could lead to a slew of potential copyright claims and other legal issues for the group.

The situation between the two parties is typically reversed. Twitch copyright claims usually affect streamers playing the work of artists on their streams, so a band using a streamer's voice is kind of interesting to see. While the voice clips are incredibly alike, making it seem like BTS did, in fact, use Greekgodx's voice, there's still a chance that its a different clip entirely. The Twitch clip shows Greekgodx's immediate reaction, though it does contain some NSFW language.

It isn't entirely clear what will happen next. There's a good chance that Greekgodx will at least try to get something for the use of his voice, but it's also possible that he simply lets it go. If the voice clip is 100% confirmed to belong to the streamer, it would effectively put the ball in his court as far as how to proceed. BTS could also reupload the song without the voice line, but whether or not that happens remains to be seen.

Greekgodx has been a controversial figure in the past, having earned a Twitch ban for a rant on the streaming site back in September. Regardless, if BTS did use his voice without his permission, the streamer is well within his rights to take action. Hopefully, the two parties are able to come to an agreement, but fans will just have to wait and see how that turns out.Former X1 member Kim Woo-seok is set to make a solo debut.

His agency Top Media shared last Wednesday that the K-Pop star will release an album in the first half of this year.

Though they didn’t disclose any information about the release, his label reportedly announced that a self-written track will be included in the album.

He has been a member of K-Pop group UP10TION since 2015 and goes by Wooshin as his stage name. Alongside his fellow bandmate Lee Jinhyuk, the singer participated in the fourth season of the popular reality TV show ‘Produce X 101’, where he rose to prominence and joined X1 in 2019.

Following a vote-manipulation investigation of the show, X1 disbanded earlier this year. Its members have been pursuing solo activities.

His bandmate also made his solo debut with mini album ‘S.O.L.’ after gaining attention on the Mnet reality show.

The UP10TION member recently bagged a solo endorsement for cosmetics brand CLIO, joining former endorsers Lee Hyori, Gong Hyojin and Sandara Park

His fan solo fan meeting was set to take place on February 22 at the Korea University but was ultimately cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis.“Boy With Luv” was BTS’ song of choice when the K-pop phenom group performed at Times Square on Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve, on Saturday Night Live and a multitude of similarly grand stages late last year. But if you were just tuning in, you would have missed quite a few worthy tracks. BTS’ discography dates back to June 2013, with the release of their debut album 2 Cool 4 Skool, and has since spanned genres, with lyrics offering social commentary and introspective musings alike.

Ahead of the seven-member ensemble’s new album Map of the Soul: 7, which drops on Feb. 21, TIME revisited BTS’ albums released over nearly seven years, including individual mixtapes by RM, Suga and J-Hope, to identify the overlooked gems. For the purposes of this list, “underrated” songs exclude title tracks released with music videos and promoted most heavily during album releases, as well as the usual fan favorites (“Silver Spoon,” “Tomorrow,” “Anpanman,” to name a few, have had their fair share of recognition.) We’ve also included “hidden tracks,” which are only found outside the realms of Spotify and Apple Music.

In no particular order, here are TIME’s picks for the most underrated BTS songs, compiled in a playlist at bottom.

The hidden track “Sea” is only available on the physical edition of the Love Yourself: Her album, so it may have evaded the notice of fans who mostly stream the group’s music. In the lyrics, BTS uses the imagery of an ocean and a desert to convey the hope and despair they experience while pursuing their dreams as K-pop artists. “The scary desert became the ocean with our blood, sweat and tears,” Suga raps. “But why is there this fear in between the happiness?” The song’s composition mirrors the theme — a cyclical, serene instrumental melody is paired with breathy vocals to create a sound that resembles the tranquil crashing of waves.

Another track from the Japanese album Face Yourself, “Don’t Leave Me,” garnered significant attention in part for being the theme song of a Japanese television series. But the merits of “Let Go” should not be overlooked. The song strips down heavy musical production in the refrain and layers the singers’ bare voices atop classical piano, highlighting the vocal colors of the four singers Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Jin’s bright tone, in particular, shines in delivering the bittersweet emotions of wrestling between holding on and letting go, the internal struggle described by the lyrics.

While most of BTS’ earlier songs are hip hop-infused tracks that pack a punch in the rap verses, “Rain” is a jazz-centric number with a spotlight on relaxed vocal lines. The airy melody flows on top of light percussion and piano, creating a melancholy mood that matches the song’s lyrics about the grayness and gloom of a rainy day. A bonus: J-Hope, who specializes in rapping, makes a rare appearance singing the mellow verses in this track.

Early on in the group’s career, BTS set itself apart by boldly addressing societal issues. In “Spine Breaker,” the group tackles income inequality — “the class system of the 21st century is divided into two, those who have and those who haven’t,” the track begins. The song’s title refers to the youth who ask their parents for “shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand,” resulting in the parents having “curved spines” from laboring to fulfill their children’s requests. Vocalist V’s deep-voiced line “that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes” warns against materialistic desires.

Released in the group’s debut year, “We On” is discussed much less among BTS’ fandom than other tracks from 2013. The number is one of the septet’s first instances of directly speaking to naysayers through their music. “Talk smack about my sunglasses, my hairstyle, my name,” RM says. “Head-scratching kids who say they hate the busy world of K-pop.” Jungkook sings the pointed lyrics ever so sweetly: “I don’t know you and you don’t know me, so please shut up.”

One of the only blues-influenced tracks in BTS’ catalogue, “Am I Wrong” was co-written by Grammy Award-winning musician Keb’ Mo, who sampled his 1994 song with the same title. The funky rhythm and upbeat melody — with Jimin’s high note as its climax — belie the track’s somber message about apathy in the information age. “If what you see on the news is nothing to you / if that comment is nothing to you / if that hatred is nothing to you / you’re not normal, you’re abnormal,” raps RM. The song was provocative at the time of its 2016 release, when it was perceived as a clapback at a former South Korean Ministry of Education official who called for a caste system and referred to people as “dogs and pigs.” In his verse, Suga raps, “We’re all dogs, pigs, become dogs because we’re angry.”

The Cypher series — rap tracks written and performed by RM, Suga and J-Hope — are some of the most emotionally raw numbers in BTS’ discography. The pre-2016 iterations excel in showcasing the rappers’ technical prowess. “Pt. 3: Killer” builds on the flow of past Cyphers and, with its more complex instrumentals, acts as a harbinger for the rap unit’s future tracks with more elevated production. RM, Suga and J-Hope’s piercing words glide across soft tunes from eastern instruments in the scathing diss track against rappers who doubt their rap skills and question their hip-hop roots.

Besides writing diss tracks to their haters, the group produced a gentle admonition to their fans. In “Pied Piper,” the members address behaviors common in the fandom. “Now stop watching and study for your test / Your parents and boss hate me / Video clips, pictures, tweets,” the track opens. “Stop, interpret the music video later.” But “Pied Piper” is more tough love than harsh criticism. “You’re not being punished,” Jin sings.

From Suga’s solo mixtape Agust D — “Agust D” is “Suga” spelled backwards, plus the letters “D” and “T” that stand for his hometown “Daegu Town” — “The Last” has received much attention for the rapper’s lyrics about depression and social anxiety. “So Far Away” is another track on the mixtape with poignant lyrics by Suga — in it, he expresses a sense of existential dread and the struggle of living without a dream. “I live because I can’t die,” Suga raps, “But I don’t have anything I want to do.” The BTS member’s gritty rap verses contrasts with singer-songwriter Suran’s ethereal chorus.

One of the less discussed tracks from RM’s 2018 solo mixtape, “UhGood” is a vulnerable expression of the BTS leader grappling with meeting expectations. “UhGood” is the English pronunciation of the Korean characters in the song’s title, which mean “falling short” and “missing each other.” Both meanings are referenced in the song’s lyrics, as RM sings about being disappointed with himself — “honestly, I trample myself, ‘Do you only amount to this?’” — and the distance between his ideal and his reality.

“Daydream” and “Airplane” are the two songs on J-Hope’s solo mixtape Hope World that were released with music videos, but the groovy rap number “Base Line” should not be overlooked. At just 90 seconds, the track is jam-packed with brass instrumentation, beats and J-Hope playfully alternating between high-pitched and low-pitched rapping. In a 2018 interview with TIME, the artist shared the influence behind this song: “These days, the baseline that’s behind my life is my deep gratitude for my life and my work.”

“Ddaeng,” a track composed by the rap unit and released for the group’s fifth anniversary, is another number not available on Spotify or Apple Music. RM, Suga and J-Hope’s creative wordplay is taken to the next level with this number. “Ddaeng” is an onomatopoeic word that mimics the dinging of a bell, and is also used to signify an incorrect answer. Repeating the word, the three members delivered another knockout aimed at the critics who, in deriding BTS, generated more buzz around the group and ended up helping propel them to the top.

O Spotify revelou um estudo sobre o gênero sul-coreano na plataforma, e listou quais países o gênero é mais ouvido. Em primeiro lugar vêm os Estados Unidos, seguido pela Indonésia, Filipinas, Japão e, em quinto lugar, o Brasil.

Além disso, o Spotify afirmou também que K-Pop é popular em todos os 79 países em que o serviço está disponível, destacando o crescimento de interesse no Egito e Vietnã. De todo esse sucesso, 73% dos ouvintes são mulheres, e 53% do público está na faixa etária de 18-24 anos. A plataforma registrou mais de 134 bilhões de minutos de faixas do gênero ouvidas.

Mas quais são os artistas mais ouvidos no serviço? Segundo o Spotify, o ranking é liderado pelo BTS, seguido por BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE e Red Velvet. Veja abaixo as canções mais ouvidas:When “Parasite” made cinematic history by winning Academy Awards not just for international film, original screenplay and director but for best picture, I was in the air, flying home to Los Angeles. I landed a couple of hours after the Oscars to a flurry of celebratory texts in the group chat I keep with my best friends. Most of us are Korean American, and we met in middle school in the late 1990s, bonding over our shared heritage — or rather our earnest love for the Korean boy band H.O.T.

We weren’t aware of this at the time, but while we discussed which H.O.T. member was cutest (Kang Ta) and vied for who got to marry him (signing notes passed in class “Mrs. Kang Ta”), we were witnessing the birth of a genre that has since become a global juggernaut. H.O.T. was one of K-pop’s first breakout acts, an early export of what has since become known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.

In 1997, loving H.O.T. made us little weirdos, teenybopping in a different world from the rest of our classmates. But today’s H.O.T. is BTS, a Korean phenomenon that sells out U.S. stadiums, performed in Times Square as part of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2020 and whose new album, “Map of the Soul: 7,” is already breaking sales records since it dropped Friday.

The Korean Wave may be riding at an all-time high, but it’s been building since the late 1990s, thanks to targeted government investment in the entertainment industry, designed to spread Korean pop culture worldwide. It wasn’t just K-pop that came into its own in the ’90s. Korean dramas started becoming wildly popular, and Korea’s new film industry announced itself with 1999’s action thriller “Shiri,” the country’s first Hollywood-style blockbuster, with a then record-breaking budget of $8.5 million.

The wave spread across Asia before reaching a global audience thanks to savvy social networking strategies and a steady stream of media with increasingly high production values. Even President Obama acknowledged the vital force of Korean pop culture during a 2012 speech in Seoul when he said, “People around the world have caught the Korean Wave, Hallyu.”

“Parasite’s” Oscars performance is a new crest in the wave, a stunning sweep at the most significant awards show on this side of the Pacific. It’s a win so strong that it signals yellow peril for our current president, who pined for the good old days when movies for white people got their due — I’m not even talking about “Green Book” here; he went all the way back to Confederate romance “Gone With the Wind.”

I’ve watched this all happen with a great sense of satisfaction. I grew up in Los Angeles, which is home to the largest ethnically Korean population outside of the major urban centers in Korea, but I’ve always felt like part of this scrappy little minority group with a desire to be known and acknowledged. When I was a kid, my classmates used to ask if I was Chinese or Japanese, and I remember snapping back, with bruised insistence, that I was Korean. This exchange usually went with the slanted-eye nonsense that every Asian kid in America seems to have endured on playgrounds in the 1980s and ’90s. Fingers pulling eyes sideways into slits — horizontally for Chinese, angled up for Japanese. I educated them enough that we settled on assigning Korean eyes a downward slant, earning a proper place for my people in the vocabulary of schoolyard harassment.

No one taught me to do this, or at least I hope they didn’t, but I recognize it now as a natural Korean reflex. A prickly, defensive sort of pride in a heritage riddled with defeat and occupation, getting demeaned and subjugated, imperialized and erased, even as we guarded a sense of wounded nationalist superiority. Maybe this is why Koreans celebrate even stupid things that feel particularly Korean — I’ve heard Koreans brag about avoiding SARS because of kimchi. Anything that we can lay claim to feels like it must be worthwhile, whether it’s high internet speeds, a perfectly phonetic alphabet, or a decadent love of pork and alcohol.

I was in late elementary school when I first delved into Korean pop culture. I had strict parents, so I didn’t get to do much outside of school, but I did go to hagwon — a cram school called Valley Newton where I spent my summer and weekend hours memorizing SAT words. Newton was in a Van Nuys strip mall on Sherman Way, anchored by the HK Market (now the Greenland Market). All of the businesses there were Korean, and they included both a CD store and a video store, where my mother sweetened my compulsory hagwon attendance with regular access to the latest in Korean media. I got mix CDs, likely unauthorized, loaded with the hits of the month; I rented VHS tapes — also possibly bootleg, labeled with white stickers written on in Sharpie — with music videos and dance performances. I started watching variety shows, where my favorite pop idols made regular appearances, and from there, I got into Korean dramas.

There followed a period of a few years when I had a knowledge of Korean pop culture that was deep and current in a way that I’ve never been patient or single-minded enough to replicate in any field as an adult. I had to work for it, with my crummy Korean and my dial-up Y2K-era internet, and I took pride in my expertise. Unfortunately, none of this made me popular or cool.

To be fair, I wasn’t consuming Korean imports because of my highbrow international tastes. In retrospect, I probably sought out Korean pop culture for the very simple reason that it showed me cute Asian boys when mainstream media did not.

As an adult, I’ve gotten angry about the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in pop culture, the dearth of desirable Asian American men on screen. But as a teen, I wasn’t thinking in those terms. I only sought what I wanted — to stare at Song Seung-heon as he emoted with his manly eyebrows — looking where I knew I could find it, a scavenger rooting around for nourishment.

If I’m being honest here, this was not all premium quality content. The dramas frothed with soap and schmaltz and cancer; people were always falling in love with possible blood relatives, then dying gorgeously while they sorted the family trees. As I grew older and more critical, I became less immersed in Korean pop culture, though I continued to watch the occasional movie or drama. My mother — who gives me regular reports on the tragedies and accomplishments of Koreans around the world — has kept me apprised of the big movies, the ones that smash through existing records every couple of years in the still young and evolving film industry.

A few of these have been internationally successful, but I was still shocked and delighted when “Parasite” broke through the way it did, so that non-Korean friends and co-workers were suddenly buzzing about this movie, telling me I had to go see it — not even because I’m Korean, but because the movie was so damn good, they had to talk about it.

When I decided to watch, I didn’t have to rent it from a video store between a Korean cosmetics shop and a Korean grocery; I saw it at Alamo Drafthouse downtown, where I paid $15 for my ticket and drank a salted caramel milkshake. I felt it then, and I felt it the night of the Oscars — a sense of personal well-being as the Korean Wave flowed into the American mainstream.

The next day, I was delighted to learn that Bong Joon Ho and the “Parasite” team had partied at Soban, a Korean restaurant a mile from my house, until 5 in the morning. Bong had apparently become a regular over the past month, a fan of Soban’s banchan and ganjang gaejang, or raw marinated crab. I got to make my small claim on this moment in the diaspora: I was the first person to review Soban on Yelp, and I told Jonathan Gold to go there and try the gaejang, prompting his glowing review back in 2011. I thought about these new Korean heroes slurping raw crab in my city, and my heart swelled with an old pride.

Le boys band, à l’heure actuelle l’un des plus grands phénomènes musicaux au monde, avait quatre dates programmées au Stade olympique de Séoul pour promouvoir son dernier album, Map of the Soul: 7 .

Au total, plus de 200.000 groupies auraient dû se masser sur quatre soirs dans l’enceinte qui avait accueilli les Jeux de 1988, a indiqué dans un communiqué Big Hit Entertainement, l’agent des sept garçons au look soigné.

Big Hit Entertainement a expliqué que cette annulation était «inévitable» car il est «impossible à ce stade de prédire l’ampleur de l’épidémie», qui génère beaucoup d’incertitude logistique pour l’organisation des concerts, mais aussi pour les spectateurs. «Nous devons prendre en compte la santé et la sécurité des centaines de milliers de spectateurs et des artistes», a poursuivi Big Hit.

BTS (abréviation de Bangtan Sonyeondan, qui signifie «Boy scouts résistants aux balles») est un phénomène musical planétaire. Il est le premier groupe de K-pop à avoir atteint le sommet des ventes aux États-Unis et en Grande-Bretagne et a enchaîné les concerts à guichets fermés à Los Angeles, Chicago ou Londres, ou encore enflammé en juin un Stade de France plein à craquer.

Map of the Soul: 7 est l’album sud-coréen qui a été le plus commandé en préventes, puisque quatre millions de copies avaient été achetées avant sa sortie dans les bacs la semaine dernière.

De nombreux événements culturels et sportifs ont été annulés ou reportés en Corée du Sud à cause de l’épidémie, parmi lesquels des matches du championnat national de football ou encore les Mondiaux de tennis de table par équipes.

Les États-Unis, dont 28.500 soldats sont stationnés sur la péninsule, et leur allié sud-coréen ont ajourné leurs prochains exercices militaires conjoints. Hyundai Motor, cinquième constructeur automobile mondial en incluant sa filiale Kia, a suspendu les opérations d’une de ses usines d’Ulsan (sud-est), dont un des employés avait été testé positif au coronavirus, rapporte l’agence sud-coréenne Yonhap.

Le groupe avait déjà suspendu la production il y a quelques semaines en raison d’une pénurie de pièces détachées chinoises, conséquence, déjà, de l’épidémie.

Vendredi, Séoul a fait état de 256 nouveaux cas, ce qui porte son total de personnes contaminées à 2.022, soit le bilan le plus élevé pour un seul pays, après la Chine.

Plus de 90% des nouveaux cas ont été enregistrés à Daegu, la quatrième ville du pays, et dans la province voisine de Gyeongsang du Nord. Ce bilan devrait continuer de grimper car les autorités ont commencé à effectuer des tests sur plus de 275.000 fidèles de l’Église Shincheonji de Jésus, une organisation qualifiée de secte par ses détracteurs, et qui est directement liée à la moitié des cas de contamination répertoriés dans le pays.

L’épidémie de coronavirus s’est répandue comme une traînée de poudre dans les rangs de ce mouvement à partir d’une de ses fidèles, une femme de 61 ans identifiée comme le patient 31.

Elle a commencé à souffrir de fièvre le 10 février et a assisté à au moins quatre offices de Shincheonji à Daegu, où se trouve le siège de l’organisation, avant d’être diagnostiquée comme porteuse du virus.

Le maire de Daegu, Kwon Young-jin, a déclaré que le total des cas dans son agglomération pourrait atteindre les 3.000, selon Yonhap. Voilà plusieurs jours que les artères de cette ville de 2,5 millions d’habitants sont désertées, beaucoup de magasins et de restaurants ayant fermé leurs portes. Vendredi, les masques étaient à nouveau largement disponibles, selon des journalistes de l’AFP.

Les autorités ont multiplié les consignes, exhortant les habitants à rester chez eux s’ils développaient des symptômes. Mais la 12e économie mondiale n’envisage pas de cordon sanitaire autour de la ville, comme la Chine a pu le faire pour Wuhan, agglomération d’où est partie l’épidémie en décembre.

K-pop band BTS has become a literal phenomenon. For outsiders, their popularity can seem baffling, but since the K-pop explosion over the last decade, they’ve dominated global music headlines. Here’s what you need to know.

BTS has racked up a lot of accolades over the last year. Their ‘Map of the Soul’ world tour recently outsold massive pop artists on StubHub like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Elton John. They’ve even received their own Funko Pop Vinyls.

BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, are a 7-piece boy band from South Korea whose popularity has skyrocketed since their expansion into global markets in the mid-2010s. They were established in 2013, and first entered U.S. Billboard charts in 2015, an achievement which marked the start of their worldwide ascent.

BTS is known for their deep lyrics, which cover topics like youth mental health, the education system, Korean society and social disparity. Much of their music covers topics that are deeply relevant for their audience of teenagers and young adults, and the group has spoken regularly about the problems facing this younger generation. While they sing primarily in Korean, their message has become incredibly popular around the world.

How did BTS get so popular?

The late 90s and early 2000s were boom periods for Korean music and culture as the country’s government loosened global censorship and began to focus on globalisation. As changes to foreign policy reshaped South Korean culture, pop groups like 2NE1 and Big Bang became the first of a wave of global music exports, a cultural exchange that became known as the Hallyu movement.

Western audiences soon became enamoured by the punchy beats and well-choreographed dance numbers of K-Pop groups, with many entering the mainstream cultural conscious and gaining a new audience despite the language barrier.

BTS’s mainstream popularity began around 2015 (after much of the Hallyu movement had been established), with the release of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2, an album that debuted at number 171 on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts. It marked their first entry into mainstream consciousness, but it wasn’t until 2017 that they truly made their mark.

In 2017, BTS peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #67 with ‘DNA’, and later appeared at number ten on the Billboard Year-End Artists of the Year chart. That same year, they collaborated with many of the U.S.’ top acts including Steve Aoki, Fall Out Boy and The Chainsmokers.

In 2019, they became the first group since The Beatles to score three number one albums in a single year with albums Love Yourself: Tear, Love Yourself: Answer and Map of the Soul: Persona all topping U.S. music charts on release.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why BTS became the internet’s favourite K-pop boy band, there are several factors that may play a part. BTS addresses issues that are increasingly relevant for their young audience, including societal displacement, expectation, prejudice and anxiety. These are topics that are rarely addressed, and are even rarer heard in pop music.

On top of that, BTS maintains an active social presence that bridges the gap between mainstream celebrity and everyday people. On Twitter, they have 23.9 million followers, and use the platform to share personal stories, moments, achievements and passions that are deeply relatable to their audience.

This social connection, as well as the impact of their music and lyrics has led to a passionate and active fanbase online.

Importantly, BTS has ascended from the status of ‘just’ a pop group. Their brand has expanded globally to include a video game where players can manage the titular pop group, an alternative universe webtoon called Save Me, a series of cartoon characters based on the singers, as well as a global collaborative art project. BTS are also active philanthropists. The band has supported UNICEF and other charity organisations in campaigns to prevent bullying, violence and youth isolation.

Since 2013, the band’s popularity has skyrocketed. They’ve become entrenched in the world of global pop culture, and with a near-religious fervour surrounding their every appearance, their popularity is only set to grow from here.It's a bird! It's a plane! It's SuperM.

The K-pop supergroup stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night (Feb. 11) to leave late-night viewers spellbound.

The project, which brings together members of established acts SHINee, EXO, NCT 127 and WayV, cut loose with a performance of “Jopping,” a single lifted from their chart-topping debut The 1st Mini Album. The LP went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last year, meaning SuperM are the first Korean group not named BTS to achieve the feat.Pre-orders for K-pop super band BTS' upcoming album have topped the 4 million mark, the biggest pre-order volume ever for a South Korean album. 



Pre-orders for "Map of the Soul: 7," set for official release on Friday, reached 4.02 million copies as of Monday, BTS' management agency, Big Hit Entertainment said, citing data from record distributor Dreamus Company. 



It is the biggest pre-order volume for any South Korean album as well as for any BTS record.



The album achieved 3.42 million copies within a week of it becoming available for pre-orders on Jan. 9, heralding the band's high-profile return to the global music scene. 



According to the track list unveiled Monday, the new album has 20 tracks, led by lead song, "ON." It also includes five hit songs from BTS' previous album, "Map of the Soul: Persona." 



Big Hit also said Tuesday that BTS will appear on American late night TV show "The Late Late Show with James Corden" on Tuesday next week (US time), the band's second appearance on the show this year following its premiere of "Black Swan" on the show last month.



The septet will join the "carpool karaoke" section of the talk show during their appearance next week, according to the agency. (Yonhap)The sights and sounds of K-pop surrounded Keisha Kang as she grew up in her native Korea.

Not only did she follow the popular music and dance stars as they charted there and around the world but she was also a former trainee to become a K-pop singer.

As well, her mother is also a huge adult K-pop singer while her father conducts K-pop orchestras. With the music in her blood — and still wanting to be part of the industry — Kang was eager to spread the genre after she immigrated to Canada 15 years ago.

Privately, she taught the unique style of K-pop dance steps (she’s trained in ballet and traditional Korean dance) for a decade but, last February, Kang branched out to set up her own studio at Coquitlam’s Henderson Centre mall. “I saw so much demand,” she said.

Her dance academy, called Mamakeish, has blossomed over the past year with some 300 students in sessional classes for kids and adults, and for everyone from beginners to advanced dancers.

“I think I have something special to offer,” the Coquitlam mother-of-two said last week. “I come from a K-pop family and I know many people.”

Among her supporters is Lia Kim, one of K-pop’s most famous choreographers, whom Kang featured on her Instagram page during a visit to Korea last month.

She also said she has connections with the big K-pop agencies such as YG Entertainment, CJ E&M and Big Hit Entertainment — the latter being the company behind the group BTS.

Although most of her students are girls of Asian descent, Kang said she would like to see students from other ethnic backgrounds try out.Bang Chan joined JYP Entertainment in 2010 and trained for seven years before debuting with Stray Kids.Chen, chanteur du groupe EXO, s'est attiré les foudres des fans sud-coréens en annonçant entretenir une relation avec une jeune femme. Son histoire met en lumière les pressions que subissent les chanteurs du secteur concernant leur vie amoureuse.

Les stars de K-Pop auraient-elles une vie privée? L’annonce du mariage de Chen, chanteur du groupe EXO, a réveillé la colère des fans sud-coréens il y a un mois. Depuis, cette révélation semble avoir libéré la parole des célébrités du secteur, astreintes par leurs labels et par la pression du public à une totale opacité quant à leurs relations amoureuses.

Tout commence à la mi-janvier lorsque Kim Jong-dae (le vrai nom du chanteur), 27 ans, publie une lettre manuscrite sur les réseaux sociaux à l'adresse de ses fans. Il y annonce avoir "une petite amie avec qui (il) souhaite passer le reste de sa vie" et laisse entendre qu'elle serait enceinte. Chen ne cache pas son angoisse à l'idée de le révéler au monde:

Si Chen était si nerveux, c'est parce qu'il savait très bien à quoi il s'exposait en annonçant à ses fans qu'il n'était plus un coeur à prendre. La réaction de cette communauté d'admirateurs, ultra-organisée et active sur les réseaux sociaux, a confirmé toutes ses peurs.

Comme le rapporte L'Express, de nombreux fans du groupe ont taxé cette décision "d'égoïste". Une manifestation de petite envergure a eu lieu devant les locaux du label SM Entertainment, afin que Chen soit exclu d'EXO. Quelques jours plus tard, un camion orné d'un panneau demandant l'exclusion du chanteur a été garé par les fans sur le parking du siège, avant d'être retiré pour stationnement illégal.

Si l'annonce de cette idylle a tant déçu les admirateurs, c'est parce qu'elle vient ternir l'idée qu'ils se font du personnage. "Certains fans nourrissent le fantasme d'épouser leur idole favorite", explique Paul Han, co-fondateur du site allkpop, à This Week in Asia. "Lorsqu'une star se marie ou entame une relation, ce fantasme disparaît".

"Certaines fans se sentent trahies quand elles apprennent que leur idole, avec qui elles ont partagé beaucoup, annonce soudainement une liaison", abonde le spécialiste de pop-culture Lee Jong-im dans les colonnes de L'Express.

Les pressions qui pèsent sur les stars de la pop sud-coréenne, industrie en perpétuelle expansion, ont déjà été pointées du doigt par le passé. Notamment à cause de la vague de suicides qui frappe le secteur depuis plusieurs mois.

Mais les révélations de Chen annoncent peut-être un changement. Depuis son message, d'autres célébrités lui ont emboîté le pas. Deux semaines plus tard, Gil, membre de l'ancien groupe Leessang, a révélé qu'il était marié depuis trois ans et qu'il avait eu un fils. Sung-Joon, mannequin et acteur de séries, a lui aussi annoncé s'être marié et être devenu père en secret. Une quatrième célébrité, le chanteur Lee Jae Hoon, a révélé qu'il était marié depuis 10 ans, et qu'il a deux enfants:

En outre, certains fans ont apporté leur soutien à Chen. les admirateurs se sont divisés en deux camps, les EXO-L ACE, qui demandent son renvoi, et les EXO-L, qui souhaitent qu'il reste. Ces derniers rassemblent leurs efforts sous plusieurs mots-clés, notamment le hashtag #ChenStays ("Chen reste").

Chen a également reçu le soutien de SM Entertainment tout de suite après l'annonce, comme le rapporte Straitstimes. Dans un communiqué, l'agence demande au public de soutenir son union et assure qu'il continuera à "travailler dur".IZ*ONE has shattered a first-week sales record for albums by girl groups of all time with its new album, the band's management agency said Tuesday.



The group's first full-length album "Bloom*Iz" sold some 184,000 copies within the first day of its release Monday at 6 p.m., Off the Record said, citing data from domestic album sales tracker Hanteo Chart.



It took less than a day for the group to break the previous record set by TWICE when its eighth EP album "Feel Special" sold some 154,000 copies in the first week of release last September.



"At the same time, IZ*ONE achieved the feat of topping the first-week album sales of more than 180,000 copies as the first girl band, just in a single day (since the release)," the agency said. 



It is the second time the 12-piece Korean-Japanese girl group has renewed the first-week album sales record for girl groups since its second EP "Heart*IZ," released in April last year, did so for the first time.



As there are still six more days to go for the final result of the first-week album sales figures for the new album, the sales number may further increase, Off the Record said. 



The band released "Bloom*Iz" Monday evening, led by the lead track, "Fiesta," symbolizing that the project girl group's high-profile career has fully bloomed. 



The album is the finale of the band's flower-themed album trilogy, characterized by the band's two previous hit songs, "La Vie en Rose" and "Violeta."



Like the previous hits, "Fiesta" became immediately sensational, topping the real-time music charts by online music streaming services, Bugs! and Soribada as of Tuesday morning. 



It also came in second on the music charts by Melon, Genie Music and streaming services. (Yonhap)K-pop phenomenons BTS pulled off a near impossible feat, when they performed in an empty Grand Central Terminal in New York City for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The South Korean septet showed off their impeccable choreography Monday night, performing their new single ‘ON’ from their recent album Map of the Soul: 7, which dropped on 21 February.

The special episode titled, The Tonight Show: Subway Special, featured the global pop stars touring around New York and visiting some of the city’s most iconic sights including a visit to Katz’s Delicatessen, playing games on the subway and ending the show with their historic performance at the historic train station.

All seven members were joined by ranks of back-up dancers for one of the most impressive performances on late night television. During their subway ride, the group talked about their phenomenal success stateside how their music has crossed both geographical and cultural boundaries.

“We came from a small label, from a small country from Asia, so we’ve proved that someone from the outside can be in the mainstream,” shared member RM.

The band also answered questions posed by their massive fan group, ‘BTS Army’. BTS’s world-conquering isn’t done yet, as the superstar group will appear tonight in a taped segment of Carpool Karaoke on The Late Late Show with James Corden. In a teaser clip for the episode, members RM, Jin,Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook ride along with the late night host as they sing bits of their hit single ‘ON’.

Their new album Map of the Soul: 7 is a culmination of all seven band member’s artistry and their seven years together as a group. The record already sold two million copies in the first two hours of release in South Korea and is expected to make bank stateside as well.

Map of the Soul: 7 offers, “an exploration of the relationship between the persona and the shadow,” writes Pitchfork in their review.

“There is some obvious overlap between the two: the negativity we unconsciously bear and its correspondence with the masks we all wear mirrors the dichotomy of managing a public face amid the looming private pressures of being a famous K-pop star.”

As the first South Korean music acts to perform on Carpool Karaoke, BTS continue to make music history, one milestone at a time.

SM True, which promoted her concerts in Bangkok, announced the decision to defer the concerts planned for Feb 22-23 to later dates due to concerns over the virus.

"The safety and health of artists, audiences and staff is our top priority and concern," the organisers posted a Facebook message.

Taeyeon, the former member of girl group Girls' Generation, planned The Unseen concerts at Thunder Dome Muang Thong Thani.

She was the second artist from South Korea who cancelled the concerts in Thailand and other Asian countries after GOT7.

GOT7 had planned their concerts at Rajamangala National Stadium on Feb 15-16 before they decided to cancel the shows.O cantor Seungri, ex-membro do grupo de k-pop Big Bang, foi acusado formalmente na última sexta-feira, 31, de ter contratado prostitutas para sócios de um de seus negócios e de fazer apostas em território estrangeiro, o que é ilegal na Coreia do Sul.

O escritório de fiscalização do Distrito Central de Seul, capital coreana, informou que as duas acusações foram formalizadas e que não pediu prisão preventiva do músico.

Segundo o órgão, Seungri contratou serviços de prostituição para seus sócios do Japão, Taiwan e Hong Kong entre dezembro de 2015 e janeiro de 2016.

A pasta considera também que, entre 2013 e 2016, Seungri apostou várias vezes em Las Vegas, nos Estados Unidos, junto com Yang Hyun-suk, fundador da produtora de k-pop YG Entertainment. Yang é considerado um dos pais do k-pop por ter sido um dos três membros da Seo Taiji and Boys, uma das bandas que revolucionaram a indústria musical do país asiático nos anos 1990.

Seungri, cujo nome verdadeiro é Lee Sung-hyun, se aposentou do mundo do entretenimento em março de 2019, depois de se tornar uma figura central em uma investigação em torno de um clube no distrito de Gangnam, em Seul, chamado Burning Sun. O local é o epicentro de uma trama envolvendo tráfico de drogas, prostituição de menores, evasão fiscal e corrupção policial.

Um dos sócios de Seungri em vários de seus negócios, Yoo In-suk, e oito outras pessoas também foram acusadas de vários crimes relacionados à boate.BTS has gained immense popularity and diehard fans around the world.

The two debuted with a song that combined rock and dance elements, which helped launch a viral sensation, boosted by the duo's appearance in the TV drama Dream High 2 prior to their debut. Though each had totally different styles and personalities, they somehow blended perfectly, with each complimenting what the other lacked. The two inevitably had a strong presence among the members of GOT7 when the group finally made their debut. Later, JJ project added four members, as well as Youngjae to form GOT7. GOT7’s beginning was a bit rough. The sampling of “Tell Me” drew attention and they became known for the acrobatics, but the group’s presence shone through thanks to their appealing tunes and the catchy melody of 2014's "A" from the group's second EP, Got Love. GOT7 immediately followed this with a full album, Identify, which was a success. In the age of streaming, it is difficult to promote the songs evenly, especially follow-up singles (in this case, a repackage album would be released instead). The production cost and other efforts to create a full-length album in the current K-pop ecosystem is quite staggering, which makes it all the more meaningful that the group followed their string of early EPs with a full album. The title, Identify, was also central in that it was released right at the moment GOT7 was standing at the crossroads of discovering their own identity.

To be honest, they were still in their transition. Shifting between the extreme images of playful, spirited boys, suddenly matured men, and adorable youngsters, GOT7 displayed a wide spectrum appeal. Fortunately, at the time, Jackson was active in variety shows to promote GOT7's name. After that, it was thanks to the Flight Log trilogy that they elevated their status to the point they've reached today. The frequent releases definitely played a big part, as they were able to move on from their early imagery to develop a more refined impression. The Flight Log trilogy showed their growth at a time when trilogy releases were quite common on the K-pop scene at the time, even if GOT7 came relatively late to that game. They differentiated themselves by demonstrating that each member participated directly in the production process and also putting each singer's individual musical talent, style and growth on display, mesmerizing hundreds of thousands with their unique appeal.

After the Flight Log series, GOT7 entered a stable orbit. In particular, the intense choreography and the title tracks produced by Jae-beom became their trademark. Each member released solo songs and became more mature and enriched through acting and other side projects, with the individual and group activities on a nearly two-track system that created a synergy effect that improved the overall team's appeal. Leader Jae-beom used the name Def. to quench his thirst as a solo artist through his Soundcloud account, which also featured albums from beloved musicians such as Primary to Deepshower. In particular, Deepshower has been lauded for his participation in George's “Boat” and Lucid Fall’s album production. Youngjae was also making his own moves, using the name Ars to create a Soundcloud account that featured music from overseas DJ/ producer Sanjoy. Jinyoung also dipped into the acting pool, but perhaps the greatest musical achievement was accomplished by Jackson, a beloved star of Korean and Chinese variety shows who successfully launched a solo music career in China. He invited Gucci Mane to feature on his songs and was himself featured on one of Goldlink's albums, making him one of the most internationally successful rappers ever from an active K-pop artist in South Korea.

GOT7 launched their first world tour in Asia and North America in 2016 and added Europe and South America on their second world tour in 2018. During the recent Keep Spinning World Tour, they were featured on a variety of media platforms, including Teen Vogue, Elle, and Fox TV. It is no exaggeration to say that GOT7 have emerged as one of the biggest global K-pop vehicles. They've attracted attention in Asia because of their earnest performances, but the popularity gained in Europe, North and South America proves that they are a phenomenon across many continents.

It's definitely a plus that several members speak English, which has earned them some added media exposure and helped them grow rapidly. Jackson's overseas activities have helped keep their name in the headlines and they are also attempting various projects to make use of each individual strengths and charms, such as Jus2. All the while, their solo activities are harmonized back into the group through great teamwork, which has helped GOT7 rise to the place they are today.If you've spent time on Twitter you've probably come across K-pop fancams before — likely in the context of the replies of a controversial tweet. (More on that later). Basically, a fancam is footage focusing on a single member of a band , usually while the group is performing. It can also be used for solo artists , because different fans will capture different points of view of the same event. Any fan's footage can be a fancam, though many die-hards like to follow fansites for more professional footage of their favorite member. Fansites are websites run by one or multiple fans who are dedicated to one specific idol or group. They follow the artists to their varied appearances, and use high-quality equipment to capture photos and videos and upload them online. The practice has become so popular in Korea that TV broadcast stations sometimes upload their own high-quality fancams after posting a full performance on YouTube.f you’ve been seeing a surplus of tiny sevens when you log onto Twitter, it’s not an influx of numerology enthusiasts, but instead another way for the ardent BTS army to show their love for the popular K-pop boy band.

Like the purple emoji hearts that BTS superfans posted in comments and tweets online, small superscript sevens have popped up in Twitter usernames, bios and the tweets themselves of loyal BTS supporters.

The number seven is significant for BTS for both obvious and less well-known reasons; for one thing, the band is made up of seven members: RM, SUGA, V, Jungkook, Jimin, Jin, and J-Hope. Their upcoming album (which drops on Friday) is titled, which can be interpreted as a nod to the number of people in the band and also to the number of years that they’ve been together, which is also seven.

However, RM also pointed out in an interview on the earlier this month that while the number seven not only references the people in the band and the time they’ve spent together, it also is a lucky number for them.

“Also, seven means very good luck, right?” he said. “Like jackpot.”

So maybe it should come as no surprise that BTS fans are eager to show support for the band by using tiny sevens as a sort of secret code online. See the best tiny sevens for BTS below.Newsmax and OANN are telling lies about the election as more people tune inOne of the K-pop industry’s biggest executives is lending a hand to one of the scene’s most promising groups in a rare display of crossing company lines.

Lee Soo-Man, a longtime pioneer in the K-pop world with his namesake SM Entertainment since the ‘90s that has helmed generation-defining acts like H.O.T, BoA, TVXQ!, Girls’ Generation, EXO and more, has been confirmed to lending his vision and producing skills for the first artist outside of his company. Lee worked with new girl group LOONA, who is under the smaller Korean label Blockberry Creative, and took part in the group’s upcoming album titled “#” that was released on February 5 with lead single “So What.” Watch below:

The 12-member-strong LOONA—who have garnered a sizable international fan community with their intricate backstory leading them to a large social-media following and chart-topping success on the Billboard and iTunes charts around the world—confirmed that Lee worked on their album at a press showcase ahead of the release of the album, marking the first time he’s produced for an outside artist since setting up in his company in 1989.

LOONA had nothing but kind words to say for Lee’s contributions. “We want to express our gratitude to producer Lee Soo-Man” member Yves told the press (according to a translation from Soompi). “Producer Lee Soo-Man says he got to know about us while working on his global project...our ‘Cherry Bomb’ cover video [originally performed by SM Entertainment artist NCT 127] caught his eye, and he judged that we have potential, so he willingly participated in production.”

Ahead of the release of the “#” album, LOONA has been sharing sneak peaks of the new songs and album artwork, with fans noting that LOONA seems to be embracing a more powerful and aggressive sound for the single “So What” instead of the sleek electro-pop sound of past singles like “Butterfly” or “Hi High.” Lee Soo-Man has been able to connect his artists with large international audiences, including his most recent project SuperM, the “supergroup” boy band made up of members from four existing SM groups, earning a No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

It will be interesting to watch to see if LOONA can also reach bigger audiences with this release given the change-up in sound, all seemingly in the name of creating a larger appeal while teaming up with one of the best in the K-pop biz. The group has shared the following “#” teasers before the EP drops.Congratulations to BTS’ Jimin, ASTRO’s Cha Eun Woo, and BIGBANG’s G-Dragon for being hailed as the top three idol members for the month of February!
