As most theatres in the world are currently closed, one musical is not letting COVID-19 get in the way of their preparation to hit the ground running when live theatre resumes.

KPOP the musical had its world premiere at Ars Nova in New York city on September 5, 2017. The musical’s book is written by Jason Kim and the production was directed by Teddy Bergman and choreographed by Jennifer Weber.

KPOP, a musical exploring the world of Korean pop, is conducting a video-based global casting call in hopes of being ready whenever live performances resume.

“We want to polish the jets so that it’s ready to take off,” said playwright Jason Kim.

It’s about the shine and the performance and the dancing and the singing – that’s huge. But people also need to be able to really tap into the emotion of it.

KPOP follows three sets of aspiring performers as they try to charm their way into the American music market. The original was an immersive experience, with the audience following performers from room to room. Kim is rewriting it for a more traditional theatre setting, and songwriter Helen Park is adding new songs.

The productions website says “We are searching the world for talented performers for an exhilarating new Broadway show that takes a fictional look inside the KPOP universe”

Online audition submissions are now open on their official website.
