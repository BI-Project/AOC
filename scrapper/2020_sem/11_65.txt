Bernie Cho, a Korean music industry executive, told CNN that "K-pop bands not only endorse big brands but become big time brands themselves." He added, "Individuals in such bands are viewed as investments." As an investment, these stars can't engage in anything that's perceived as scandalous, including drinking, drugs, or even dating. Cho added, "Many of the biggest Korean music management companies are also publicly traded stocks on the Korean stock exchange. Sensational headlines can take a serious hit on the bottom line."

For example, look no further than K-pop artists HyunA and E'Dawn, who were suspended by their record label, Cube Entertainment, after coupling up in 2018, according to CNN. Fan backlash over the pair's relationship caused Cube's stock price to drop several points. As a result, the label said, their trust in the artists was "broken beyond repair," per Korea Herald. While the furor over the scandal has since died down, dating is still a taboo for K-pop idols and trainees, said Lee Jong-im, a researcher at the Center for Culture & Society, via Korea Herald. "Trainees have been conditioned to refrain from dating in order to succeed," Lee said.

In some cases, dating bans are openly acknowledged. JY Park, CEO of JYP Entertainment, wrote of a three-year ban at the label, during which trainees are restricted from dating and instead encouraged to focus on practicing and rehearsing.
