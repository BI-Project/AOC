MANILA, Philippines — Former beauty queen turned singer Imelda Schweighart remained unfazed after receiving flak for slamming Filipinos’ love for Kpop, and even threatened to sue those who are bashing her.

In her Instagram story on Tuesday, the Miss Philippines Earth 2016 first said that Facebook disabled her account, and is offering P25,000 to whoever can recover it.

“I can’t recover my FB, nireport ata ng marami. Sayang naman (What a waste),” Schweighart then said.

Schweighart, in another Instagram Story entry, then threatened that she will take her bashers on social media to jail.

“I have been listing names after consulting to my lawyer,” she said.

“I’m filing a case against every single person who has been messaging me under RA 10175 Cybercrime Law for Online Harassment, Invasion of Privacy, cyberstalking and defamation of character,” she added.

The singer also told her detractors that they have one day to “remove your words ‘till I really get on with this.”

“You are all getting on my nerves, don’t get me mad. I’m a nice person but not so nice when mad,” she warned.

Her warning came as she drew flak for saying “Filipinos are losing their identity” in their appreciation for Kpop.

“Filipinos are losing their identity trying to be like [Koreans]. Konting (Have a bit of) pride, please?” she previously said of Kpop on her Facebook account.
