The reason Blackpink fans are so upset with YG Entertainment

Ever since their breakout performance at Coachella in 2019, the all-female K-Pop group, Blackpink, has made an indelible impression on a stateside audience — all at a time when Korean pop music has undoubtedly merged into the mainstream. So it's understandable that fans of Blackpink — commonly known as BLINKs — are in an uproar over the girl group's lack of a "comeback" in 2020, a term K-Pop fans commonly use to refer to the release of new material or a new tour.

Rather than directing their ire at the band (who, to be fair, have very little control over when their material is distributed or when their performances are scheduled), BLINKs have instead targeted Blackpink's agency and record label, YG Entertainment. And, honestly, there's a good chance that their anger isn't unwarranted.

So what's the deal with YG Entertainment? And why are BLINKs so angry at the management agency?
