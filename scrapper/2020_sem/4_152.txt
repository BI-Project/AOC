April 8 this year marks what would've been SHINee member and solo artist Jonghyun's 30th birthday. The idol was a prolific songwriter, as well as being a powerful performer whose vocals commanded your attention.

His way with words and melodies is just one of the reasons we can never forget him and his impact on K-pop. Not only did Jonghyun write all of his solo songs himself, and produce most of them, he was also an incredible songwriter for other artists.

During his career he wrote songs for SHINee and his solo work, but also contributed to albums from Taemin, Lee Hi and EXO.

Here's just some of the songs you may not have known were originally written by him.

While Jonghyun may no longer be with us, his legacy endures through the incredible music he gifted us.
