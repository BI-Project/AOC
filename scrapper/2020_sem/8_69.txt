K-pop stars BTS have smashed YouTube records with new single Dynamite, with the video viewed more than 100 million times in the 24 hours following its release.

The South Korean band's track garnered the most views ever for a music video in its first day on the platform - beating a record of 86.3 million views set by fellow K-pop act Blackpink earlier in 2020.

With 101.1 million views in total in its first day, the BTS track also set a new record for the biggest music video premiere in YouTube history - with more than three million fans tuning in to watch its initial release.

Dynamite is also leading the race for the number one slot in this week's official UK chart and has already topped the iTunes chart in more than 100 regions, including the UK.

BTS, which stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan, or Beyond The Scene, are a seven-member group featuring RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook.

Active since 2013, the boyband have risen to worldwide fame in the past few years and were last year named among the 100 most influential people of 2019 by Time magazine.

They also made history as the first Korean act to play at Wembley last year, after selling out their first night in 90 minutes.

Dynamite, a song which features name-drops for US basketball star LeBron James, The Rolling Stones and King Kong, is their first single to be sung fully in English.

It was 1,700 chart sales ahead of Joel Corry & MNEK's five-week chart-topper Head & Heart in the Official Chart first look announced on Sunday.

While they have already topped the UK album chart twice, this would be BTS's first UK number one single should it stay ahead.

Until then, they are celebrating their YouTube record.

However, it could be short-lived one - with Blackpink looking to win back the title, releasing their new single, Ice Cream, with US star Selena Gomez on Friday.
