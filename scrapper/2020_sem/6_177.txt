The star had given the money to the former manager for a real estate deal, but it was used for gambling instead.

Lisa from K-pop girl group Blackpink was a victim of fraud by her former manager, who scammed her out of 1 billion won (US$820,000).

This has been confirmed through a statement by her agency, YG Entertainment, that read: “After looking into the matter, we confirmed that Lisa was a victim of fraud by former manager ‘A’."

The statement on Soompi revealed that Lisa, whose real name is Lalisa Manoban, had chosen to “settle this amicably, as the former manager was someone Lisa had trusted”.

The manager has reimbursed a part of the sum and has since left the company after agreeing on a payment plan for the rest of the money.

YG Entertainment added that they were “taking preventive measures so that this does not happen again.”

Korean media outlet Market News reported about the scam on Tuesday (Jun 2), writing that Lisa had given the money to the manager for real estate opportunities, who then used it for gambling.

A source told the outlet that “A” had worked with Blackpink since their debut and was someone that Lisa trusted from the early stages of her career. The source added that Lisa, who is Thai, had been in South Korea by herself since she was young, which left her “very vulnerable to these things”.

Blackpink recently collaborated with pop star Lady Gaga on a track for her newest album Chromatica. The song, called Sour Candy, was released last week and has since been a hit among fans.
