JYP Entertainment, one of the leading companies in the K-pop industry, has reportedly sought a restraining order and filed criminal charges against a man supposedly stalking Im Nayeon of the girl group Twice.

In a statement translated and published by Korean entertainment news site Soompi, JYP Entertainment said it filed criminal complaints to the Seoul Gangnam Police Station against a man stalking Twice vocalist Nayeon.

The company, which manages Twice, also sought a restraining order from the Seoul Central District Court.

"Previously, the stalker who attempted to approach Nayeon continuously was warned under police order several times already to not approach her. However, the stalker continuously took actions that ignored [the warnings]," said JYP Entertainment.

Last week, Nayeon was placed under police protection after the stalker, identified in other reports as a German man, attempted to approach her while they were on board a plane from Japan to South Korea.

JYP Entertainment earlier said Nayeon experienced "discomfort and anxiety" due to the plane incident.

Twice, which has 9 members, is one of the most popular acts in the K-pop industry today and was recently picked to endorse local clothing brand Bench.

Stalkers and obsessive fans are a problem in South Korea's entertainment industry, with some engaging in behaviors that invade the artist's privacy, such as breaking into dormitories, and accessing personal information like cellphone numbers and flight details.

In 2018, 3 fans boarded a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight in Hong Kong only to take pictures of the K-pop boy band Wanna One and got off the plane before it departed.
