Due to heavy rain in London, the BTS bandmates chose to stay indoors for the 93rd episode of “Run BTS!” to safeguard their health ahead of the Wembley concert.Instead of exploring the city, they played their own version of Monopoly in two teams. They went wild when they heard that the winners would be rewarded with instant noodles.“You have to understand that we are at the end of our (international) tour, and we miss Korean food so much,” said J-Hope. RM muttered that he had almost reached his limit. Jungkook and Jimin clapped at the sight of kimchi, and V could not stop smiling at the news.Jungkook beat Jin after 30 seconds on the step counter, but was disheartened when he rolled the dice and came up with zero. RM was surprised when he got the nonsense quiz while Suga continued to fail at guessing capital cities.Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/170908.Right after a press conference in Seoul, Kpop Herald reporter Hong Dam-young brought viewers along for a tour of the transcontinental art project that K-pop band BTS dreamed up.“‘Connect, BTS’ finally kicked off in Seoul and is happening right now here at DDP,” she said, referring to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, before stepping back inside to look at the collaborative project that involved artists and curators from around the globe. The art exhibit was unveiled earlier this month at the Serpentine Gallery in London, then popped over to Berlin and Buenos Aires, and will come to New York early next month.Spotted at the entrance was Kang Yiyun, the only Korean artist included in the array of collaborators, talking to another reporter, explained Hong. The London-based media artist came up with a projection mapping installation titled “Beyond the Scene,” which Hong pointed out. It was inspired by the septet’s dance moves and borrows its title from a BTS slogan that the group coined in 2017.After viewers had some time to enjoy the media installation piece, Hong moved on to a work by Ann Veronica Janssens titled “Green, Yellow and Pink.”Watch the full clip at https://www.vlive.tv/video/172619.The five-piece act NU’EST resumed its late-night diner-themed live broadcast for the first time in 2020.The musicians began by reporting what they had done during the Lunar New Year’s holidays.Baekho went to his parents’ house on Jeju Island and all he did was eat.Hwang Minhyun had a feast of healthy food. “My sister came with her arms filled with food sent by our mother,” he said.Aron, on the other hand, had a hard time recalling what he had eaten and Ren said he’d had quite a lot of makgeolli, a traditional Korean alcoholic beverage, making the bandmates laugh.Then it was time to begin the cooking competition. JR took the role of host and the rest formed two teams as Aron, the best cook among them, reluctantly said he would trust his teammate Ren.They were given a range of ingredients and after a brief discussion, Aron and Ren decided to make “jeon,” or traditional Korean pancakes. Baekho and Hwang Minhyun chose “tteok mandu guk,” a rice cake and dumpling soup.Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/172481.Kim Inseong of the nine-piece boy band SF9 took to V Live to chat with fans and told them in advance that his upcoming special appearance on a music chart program the next day would feature a Christmas carol.“I will do it with someone and the performance will be warm-spirited,” he said, acknowledging with a smirk that the timing was slightly off.He tried to continue the livestream on the rooftop of his company’s building, but came back inside as it was a little too loud.The idol sympathized with fans who felt the promotion period for “Good Guy,” the title track from the band’s first full-length album, was too short. The band will soon deliver its last performance to promote the track.He also discussed which hair color he should choose next, telling viewers he was torn between black and pink.“It would have been nice if I could have dyed it in pink for our activities,” said Kim, adding that he was slightly worried that his hair might not be able to withstand the multiple dyeing processes necessary to make it dark.Watch the full clip at https://www.vlive.tv/video/172632.Naver’s real-time broadcasting app V allows fans to interact with their favorite K-pop stars through live broadcasts.
