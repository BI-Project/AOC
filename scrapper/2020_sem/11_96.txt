Following its initial announcement, K-pop giant SM Entertainment has finally debuted its newest girl group, aespa, with their first-ever single “Black Mamba.” The team has been receiving global attention for its unconventional format of featuring four digital avatars and four human members.

For those who have yet to check out the fledgling music act, aespa is comprised of KARINA, NINGNING, WINTER and GISELLE, and their virtual counterparts. Each member connects with her alter ego through a mysterious mobile app called Synk. In the music video for their debut track “Black Mamba,” the musicians are captured dancing with digital graphics of a giant snake atop a vibrant, neon-lit background. The song, boasting powerful beats, highlights each member’s forte such as NINGNING’s vocals and GISELLE’s rap verse. The end of the roughly four-minute-long clip seems to tease the next step for aespa, as a distorted human figure emerges with glitching digital pixels.
