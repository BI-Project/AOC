Dynamite is the latest English-language single from the band, which was released in August. The song quickly became YouTube's most-viewed music video in its first 24 hours of going live, with 384 million views.

The video that will premier in Fortnite will be a new choreographed version of Dynamite and it will be going live this week inside Fortnite's Party Royale mode.

Additionally, starting September 23, players can purchase a bundle with two emotes choreographed after BTS. These new moves will let players bring some BTS style to the premiere or anywhere in Fortnite and will cost 800-V-Bucks.

Epic Games lists the event as starting on Friday at 8pm EDT, which means it will begin the early hours of Saturday morning for us in the UK.

How to watch the event in Party Royale

In case you're new to Fortnite, you'll be able to find Party Royale from the lobby screen.

This mode removes all weapons and instead of battling it out with other players, this is a space to chill out and hang with friends.

From the lobby screen, you can access Party Royale by pressing the 'Change' box in the bottom right corner.

Doing so will bring up a list of available modes, from this list you'll want to select Party Royale mode and press accept.

Once you do this, you'll be back in the lobby screen and you can invite some friends along to your squad, then ready up and press play to drop in.

The performance will be taking place at the Main Stage, which you can find using the map below.

Considering how popular BTS is, you might want to make sure you log in early enough to grab a space in case the servers fill up.

It doesn't look like this will be a proper performance like the Travis Scott Astronomical event or the recent Spotlight events, but instead will be all about the new music video being shown.

BTS became the first K-pop group to win a Billboard Music Award, and their album 'Love Yourself: Tear' topped the US charts this June, again making them the first K-pop band to do so.
