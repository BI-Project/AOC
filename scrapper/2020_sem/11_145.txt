"So ABC implying all Asians look the same?!"

BTS was mistaken for Kpop group NCT during ABC’s coverage of the AMAs.

Twitter user @Nicole_Tweetss captured the footage in which entertainment reporter George Pennacchio introduced the BTS just before a clip of SM Entertainment’s sub-group NCT 127 was shown.

“Still waiting on a correction and an apology…” the Twitter user captioned the footage whilst tagging ABC, Pennacchio and On The Red Carpet.

Pennacchio was explaining that BTS had were hoping to maintain their winning streak following the 2018 and 2019 AMAs.

Twitter users blasted ABC for the blunder, calling broadcasters out for racism.

“So @ABC7 @abc7george @OnTheRedCarpet implying all Asians look the same?! What’s the point of having a segment called FACEism when your own network is promoting racism?” Responded one Twitter user.

“oh no not THIS again… bts≠nctRaised back of hand damn stuff like this is SO disappointing CAN YALL DO YOUR RESEARCH?? ITS NOT THAT HARD,” another wrote.

BTS went on to win two awards at the 202 AMAs – Favorite Social Artist and Favorite Pop Group. The South Korean singers also performed their hits ‘Life Goes On’ and ‘Dynamite’ remotely from Seoul.
