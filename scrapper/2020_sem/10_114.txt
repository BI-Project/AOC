As part of Korea Music Festival's 4th edition, the concert series is holding a Drive-in Festival.

Slated to take place this weekend, the Korea Music Drive-In Festival is a grand concert celebration featuring over 30 musical acts. This is a rare chance for local K-pop fans to see their idols in-person after the onslaught of concert and tour cancellations this year.

The festival will happen between 31 October and 1 November at the Incheon International Ferry Terminal at 6PM (KR Standard Time). For fans outside of Korea, the festival will also be livestreamed starting at 2PM (TH/ID Standard Time) 3PM (Standard Time) via Outlook Events.

The festival will feature an array of Korean musical acts, spanning from K-pop to trot. Fans cans expect to see performances from NCT U, PENTAGON, MOMOLAND, ATEEZ, Park Jae-Jung, Jungyup, Cherry Bullet, (G)-IDLE, CLC, Astro, and many more.

Korean Music Drive-In Festival is the latest in socially distanced concerts around the world, following Bangkok's Tuk Tuk drive-in festival in August and the UK's Sam Fender's socially distanced show earlier this year.

To watch the festival, fans can opt between two streaming quality options - 720p and 1080p, the former priced at USD 29 (SGD 40, PHP 1422) for single-day tickets and USD 47 (SGD 64, PHP 2275) for package tickets, while the latter is priced at USD 35 (SGD 48, PHP 1706)and USD 58 (SGD 80, PHP 2845).
