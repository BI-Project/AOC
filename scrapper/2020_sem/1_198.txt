Several members of the South Korean boy band EXO are set to return to Manila in February to meet their Filipino fans.

The event marks the 8th anniversary of Nature Republic, which the EXO members endorse, in the country.

Nature Republic Philippines said they will announce further details about the event soon.

Formed by SM Entertainment, EXO debuted in 2012 with 12 members. Over the years, 3 members have departed the band.

The group currently has 6 active members in South Korea. Members Xiumin and D.O. are currently enlisted for their mandatory military service, while Chinese member Lay is promoting in his home country.

Last August, the group visited Manila for a 2-night concert at the Mall of Asia Arena.

EXO’s notable songs include “Growl,” “Love Shot,” and “Ko Ko Bop,” which spawned a dance challenge in the Philippines.

The group’s latest single, “Obsession,” peaked at No. 1 on Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart and was picked as the best K-pop song of 2019 by the music publication’s critics.
