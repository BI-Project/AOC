The internet is a treasure trove truly! Yes, there is the occasional (okay a little more than that) hate and trolling but one might unearth things from the creative conglomerate at work. You might have had your daily dose of topical news in mind when you went up the web but what you come back with is more than just that. From memes about the newest templates to GIFs from latest fan-favourite shows and more - cause the social media currency is always evolving - you never know what will hit you unless, you know you do! In fact, something similar has hit us and it is raining crossovers between Bollywood and K-Pop! Featuring bands like BTS and BLACKPINK, these videos are viral for a (and more) reasons.

Recently, BLACKPINK’s ‘How You Like That’ dropped and fans were ecstatic to see the famous girl band’s first studio album but it has now been replaced by sheer euphoria of seeing them dancing to Pardesia. You heard it right; Jisoo, Lisa, Jennie and Rosé can be seen dancing to the groovy number thanks to the imaginative minds behind Instagram handle What The Cut? And you gotta see it to believe it.

Not just them, even the Bangtan Boys aka BTS can be seen in a mashup where Akshay Kumar's Hookah Bar is playing in the background. And no, you can’t unsee it.

Earlier, another video of the BTS gang had gone viral that had them shaking legs to Salman Khan-Sushmita Sen's Chunari Chunari and I don’t know if it was imposed anymore.

Now, I don’t know about you but I’m looking at a different genre altogether. It is definitely the flavour of the season, to say the least, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who is excited about it. No, seriously, where you at K-Pop fans?
