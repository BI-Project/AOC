Will Blackpink be a threat to BTS in 2020?

While it might have its critics, it can't be denied that Korean pop music (or K-Pop) has not only made an impression on audiences in the U.S., but is stateside for the long-haul. Need proof? Look no further than the popularity of Korean boyband BTS.

The seven-person group (comprised of members V, J-Hope, Jimin, RM, Suga, Jungkook, and Jin) has taken America by storm ever since they became "only the third group in 50 years to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200 charts in less than 12 months," per CNN. The two other groups? The Beatles and The Monkees. Fittingly, CNN even compared BTS' American debut to Beatlemania.

That being said, BTS is far from the only K-Pop mega-group to have made its mark in the hearts (and ears) of American music-lovers. Blackpink, a four-part all-female K-Pop group (made up of members Jisoo, Lisa, Ros√©, and Jennie), have been long-standing darlings of the South Korean pop scene since 2016. The group managed to make its debut on the Billboard 200 in 2019 with the EP "Kill This Love" and a single of the same name, complete with an American tour and a history-making performance at one of the United States' biggest music festivals.

Even though BTS was previously on hiatus and Blackpink took a break as well, it's beginning to look like we have a battle of the (K-Pop) bands on our hands. If that's the case, does this mean Blackpink will be a threat to BTS in 2020?
