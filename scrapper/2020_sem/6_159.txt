Momoland is the latest K-pop act to sign with U.S. representation, ICM Partners announced on Monday (June 22).

ICM, which has recently signed other K-pop acts such as Chung Ha and AleXa, is now working with the six-member girl group, representing them worldwide excluding Asia.

Momoland, based under MLD Entertainment in South Korea since 2016, is best known for viral hits “Bboom Bboom” and “Baam,” and recently released “Starry Night” in June. They are expected to release a full-length album (LP) in late summer.

The deal is part of ICM’s partnership with KAMP Global, which is best known for its 2019 K-pop music festival in Singapore.

"We're thrilled to be representing Momoland, who are now primed for the world stage,” said ICM Partners Vice President Jon Pleeter. “From [debut show] Finding Momoland, the girls have risen to global sensations, and with our partners, KAMP Global and MLD Entertainment, ICM Partners will continue to grow the Momoland brand through multiple platforms at the agency."

Though live music events are cancelled for the foreseeable future due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, ICM sees an investment in Momoland, and K-pop in general, as an investment into the future.

“Due to Covid-19, global touring has been put on a temporary 'pause,' however when touring resumes, we believe the appetite for K-Pop will be exponentially bigger,” says Pleeter. “ICM will be well positioned to help grow and service the genre.”
