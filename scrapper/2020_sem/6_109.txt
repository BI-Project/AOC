Over two decades ago, Salman Khan and Sushmita Sen danced their ways into our hearts with Chunnari Chunnari. Today, the hugely popular K-pop band BTS is following in their footsteps - almost. A mashup video of BTS dancing to the song Chunnari Chunnari from the 1999 movie Biwi No 1 is currently going viral on social media, and chances are it will make your jaw drop with its perfect syncing of choreography to music.

The mashup was shared by Instagram account 'Filmforfare' about a week ago, and has since collected over a thousand impressed comments.

In the mashup video, the seven members of the South Korean boy band are seen grooving to Chunnari Chunnari. The video - actually a clip of the K-pop group's dance practice to Boy With Luv - has been perfectly synced to the catchy tune of Chunnari Chunnari to create a mashup that has left people in splits.
