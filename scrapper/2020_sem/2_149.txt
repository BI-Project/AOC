Time to practise your Sorry, Sorry moves, K-pop fans, because Super Junior, is coming to Kuala Lumpur next month!

The legendary boy band is making their return to Malaysia with a full concert on March 1,5pm, at the Aziata Arena, Bukit Jalil, KL, which is part of its Super Junior World Tour – Super Show 8: Infinite Time tour.

Formed in 2005, Super Junior was one of the first K-pop male groups to breakthrough on the international scene, thanks in part to its 2009 mega-hit Sorry, Sorry, which also launched a global dance craze. They also scored big hits with Mr. Simple, Sexy, Free & Single, MAMACITA, Black Suit, Lo Siento, among others.

Currently comprising eight members (Leeteuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun, Shindong, Yesung and Eunhyuk), Super Junior fully reformed for the first time in nine years last year after its youngest member, Kyuhyun, completed his two-year mandatory military service last May. Super Junior released its latest and ninth full-length album last month – Timeless, which is the finale of the band's time-themed album trilogy (which includes Time Slip, released in October and Time Line released in November).

Priced from RM272 up to RM802, tickets are now available at this link: bit.ly/ss8inKL.
