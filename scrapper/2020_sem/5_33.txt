South Korean girl group SECRET NUMBER was meant to make their entrance on 26 March 2020, but their debut had been delayed by the developing coronavirus situation. Now, they're finally set to take the stage.

Managed by VINE Entertainment, the five-member group includes Dita Karang, an Indonesian who has joined the girls as the main dancer and lead vocalist. Prior to her debut, she appeared in 1MILLION Dance Studio's choreography to Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's 'Gimme On Up'.

"Can't believe this was almost 3 years ago," she writes in an Instagram throwback to her graduation. "I'm so excited for what comes next (...) I'm also still working towards my goals and so can you!"

The other members of the group are Léa (Ogawa Mizuki ), Jinny Park, Soodam Lee, and Denise Kim. Both Denise and Jinny are Korean-American, while Léa hails from Japan.

"We are the only girl group where all the members were born in different places. All of our backgrounds and cultures are different, and we are confident that will create good synergy going forward," Léa shares, according to a translated statement.

The group's tracklist has also been unveiled on Instagram, revealing two new singles, 'Who Dis?' and 'Holiday'. Their debut MV for 'Who Dis?' has already amassed nearly two million views on YouTube despite only being released a day ago (19/05), to the delight of fans on Twitter who have been celebrating all the group's accomplishments since their debut.
