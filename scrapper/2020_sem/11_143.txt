Here's how K-pop fans are attempting to drown out Trump supporters

K-pop fans have proven they are a force to be reckoned with time and time again. In 2020, the fanbase created the "fancam" tactic to get points across online, a strategy that entails an audience member filming a super up-close video of K-pop stars during a live performance and posting the video on Twitter to cause an online distraction for a larger cause, as Newsweek noted. Then, people copy and share the videos, so Twitter gets flooded with these concert clips.

The fanbase first caught worldwide attention when they implemented this method during the reignited Back Lives Matter movement in America, with protests breaking out in response to the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, as reported by Vox. Fans flooded the internet with these K-pop concert videos to distract members of law enforcement from learning information about protests and finding protesters in person. The K-pop fan base, along with TikTok users, then took credit for buying tickets to and therefore inflating the popularity of a Trump rally in Tulsa, Okla., according to The Guardian. When it came time for the rally, there was a noticeable amount of empty seats, which may have resulted from the actions of these creative social media users.

Now, the K-pop fan base has harnessed their power for Election night â€” here's how they are attempting to drown out Trump supporters.
