I'm not sure exactly how big the Venn diagram of K-pop fans and lovers of Big Hero 6: The Series really is, but if you're one of the people who fall at the center of those circles, you're going to love this. The next episode of the Disney XD animated series is going to introduce its own K-pop band, which will be fronted by a pair of actual K-pop stars, and we've got the first chance to see, and more importantly, hear, that band. It will be called 4 2 Sing and it's brought to life thanks to Jae Park of DAY6 and Nichkhun of 2PM. Give it a listen in the video above.
