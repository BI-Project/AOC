Krystal is reportedly ending her relationship with her agency, SM Entertainment, after a decade.

The 25-year-old South Korean singer and member of girl group f(x) is reportedly exiting the agency to begin somewhere new, according to Ilgan Sports on Tuesday (August 18) via Soompi.

“According to the report, Krystal has already met with several well-known actor management companies, many of which have reached out to her first after hearing that she was becoming a free agent. It was said that while she has held meetings with these agencies, she has not yet discussed a detailed contract with any of them. She is reportedly looking for an agency that will both support her as an actress and go along with her plans to release music,” the outlet reports.

“Our exclusive contract with Krystal expires in late August. We will continue to have discussions with Krystal about renewing the contract,” SM Entertainment said in response to the news.

Krystal‘s bandmates, f(x)’s Amber and Luna, left SM Entertainment in 2019 following the end to their own contracts.
