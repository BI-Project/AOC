Australian K-pop stars have spoken up about the bushfire emergency in that country, sharing their thoughts and feeling about seeing their home face such a tragedy.

“It breaks my heart to see this,” wrote Rosé of Blackpink on Instagram. “Australia is on fire and it has been for too long now. I am heartbroken for the people and homes suffering from the fires and the millions of innocent and beautiful wildlife creatures that are injured and dying right now. Australia is a place that I grew up in and I am so sad to see this happen to such a beautiful country.”
