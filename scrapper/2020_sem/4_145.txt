On April 13, Twice's official YouTube channel released the first trailer for Twice: Seize the Light, a YouTube Originals documentary series that allows fans to follow as they embark on the North American dates of last year's Twicelights Tour.

If you have YouTube Premium, you can watch the entire Twice: Seize the Light series when it airs on April 29, but if not, don't worry — a new episode of the eight-part series will be released every Wednesday.

I can't wait to find out more about Twice through this show and relive all the best parts of the Twicelights Tour too! ✨
