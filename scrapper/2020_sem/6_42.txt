• K-pop superfans have turned to social-media activism with actions like drowning out racist hashtags and spamming a police app with fancams.
• After joining TikTok teens in claiming to have helped inflate expectations for President Donald Trump's comeback rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the K-pop stans are back in the spotlight.
• Recent events have contributed to their new reputation online. Here's a timeline.

K-pop superfans have been heralded recently as unlikely heroes in the fight against online racism in the wake of George Floyd's killing and Black Lives Matter protests.

Now, members of the sizable K-pop fandom — which is actually better described as a collective of individual fandoms focused on idols like BTS or Blackpink — have gained widespread attention for turning their focus on President Donald Trump, mounting a campaign (along with TikTok teens) that they say helped inflate expectations for Trump's rally over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by reserving thousands of tickets and not showing up.

A series of flashy, viral moments that seemingly showed K-pop stans (particularly on Twitter) repurposing fandom tactics to troll racists, police departments, and now the president have caused a kind of paradigm shift in the way the fandom is perceived online. Once local Twitter's annoying adversaries, K-pop fans are now being heralded by some as heroes.

Reactions have typically included surprise, given the fandom's recent elevation into the news cycle. In reality, K-pop fans took actions in support of Black Lives Matter before many of their idols did. Past that, the structure and size of K-pop fandoms in particular mean they can mobilize on platforms like Twitter at the drop of a hat.

That being said, just because the fandom has cemented itself in the public consciousness as a series of fancam-happy, anti-racist digital watchdogs doesn't mean racism doesn't persist within the fandom itself. Several Black K-pop fans told Insider about ways they said they experienced anti-Blackness in K-pop stan communities and how recent discourse had erased Black fans' voices from the conversation.

While the vigilante narrative overshadows a much more nuanced reality, it's exploded over social media and mainstream news over the past several weeks. Here are the events that led to K-pop fans' new reputation as the stans you can call when you need to get things done.
