The winners of the 15th annual Podcast Awards have been announced.

Also known as the People's Choice Podcast Awards, the Podcast Awards have been honouring the best podcasts determined by the general public since 2005. The final round of voting this year enlisted over 5500 listeners and podcasters to decide the winners for 20 categories including Arts, Music, Games, Business, and more.

For this year’s Coverville Podsafe Music Category, K-pop Daebak hosted by Eric Nam emerged as the winner, while How Did I Get Here hosted by DAY6's Jae and AleXa clinched the spots for The Adam Curry People's Choice Award and the Rob Has a Podcast Entertainment Category.

Both podcasts fall under DIVE Studios, a podcast network that creates content primarily for “international K-pop fans, Asian Americans and audiences who appreciate Asian arts and culture”. The Tablo Podcast, by Epik High's Tablo, was also nominated for Society - Culture, but was outvoted by Once Upon a Crime.

Other winners include Dads Drinking Bourbon for the Arts, Things I Got Wrong at Trivia for Games & Hobbies, Commit or Quit for TV & Film, and more. Find out which other podcasts won here.
