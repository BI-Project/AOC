SEVENTEEN had an incredibly successful year in Japan!

On November 27, HMV—one of Japan’s leading music retailers—revealed its year-end rankings of the best-selling albums of 2020.

SEVENTEEN dominated the K-pop list for 2020, sweeping the top four spots on the list (and claiming five out of the top ten).

The group’s hit Japanese single “Fallin’ Flower,” which went double platinum in May and broke records as it topped the Oricon charts earlier this year, topped this year’s rankings at No. 1. No. 2 went to SEVENTEEN’s Korean mini album “Heng:garæ,” while their Japanese mini album “24H” came in at No. 3 and their recent Korean special album “; [Semicolon]” followed at No. 4.

SEVENTEEN also claimed No. 10 on the list with the Kit version of their 2019 Korean album “An Ode.”
