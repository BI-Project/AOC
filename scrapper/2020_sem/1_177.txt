Looks like Red Velvet’s getting a Troll-ish upgrade! The K-pop girl group will be featured in the upcoming Trolls World Tour film, which is set to arrive on April 17 and stars the likes of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake.

Excitement erupted amid fans of the act after Red Velvet and their 2019 song “Zimzalabim” appeared in a Trolls World Tour trailer that was released by Thailand film distributor Major Group on Wednesday (Jan. 15). DreamWorks Animation has since confirmed the quintet's inclusion in the film to Billboard.
