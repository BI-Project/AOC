Local broadcaster MBC announced Thursday the name of 11 K-pop stars who will participate in a dog agility competition.



The lineup of the "2020 Idol Woof Woof Championship" includes MAMAMOO's Moonbyul, GOT7's Youngjae, Golden Child's Jaehyun and Bomin, (G)I-DLE's Shuhua, Lovelyz's Jisoo, Cosmic Girls' (WJSN) Soobin, Loona's HeeJin and Choerry, Kim Woo-seok and former Wonder Girls member Yubin. 



It is the first time a Korean entertainment program has featured a dog agility competition, in which a handler directs the animal through an obstacle course without touching or offering the dog incentives like food.



"For two months of training, the stars and their dogs interacted closely and made good memories," MBS said. "Some dogs showed potential to become dog-agility professionals."



The show will air in fall, but the exact date has not been set.
