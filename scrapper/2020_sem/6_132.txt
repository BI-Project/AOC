As America grapples with the outrage over another black person's death at the hands of police -- Floyd was suffocated by a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest -- the issue has gained notice around the world including in the Korean-music industry, an industry heavily inspired and influenced by black music and culture. While the first responses to the tragedy came from Korean-American and hip-hop artists, the impact has grown to many different artists using their platforms and encouraging their fans to donate, act as allies and take action in the name of Black Lives Matter. A number of K-pop acts have shared their feelings and hopes for justice on social media. See their posts and what causes they are supporting below.
