The artist ColorTheBen dropped his new song on 13th November, attracting the worldwide hiphop community. The MV shows things we are not as used seeing in typical K-MVs such as cigarettes or a bottle of alcohol, but that does not take away the charm of the song. The artist´s voice has a unique color which is easy to listen to and lures people to hitting that “play again” button.
