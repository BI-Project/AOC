British K-Pop artist and reality TV star, Oli London has come out claiming he is Korean on his new TV series ‘Plastic Surgery Knifemares’ on the UK’s 5Star TV network. Oli, who is best known for his appearances on U.S. TV shows Dr. Phil, Botched and Daily Mail TV revealed the extreme lengths he goes to look Korean including having whitening injections, Korean-made filler, laser procedures on his eyelids and shaving his bones down.

Appearing with a cardboard cutout of Jimin, whom he married in Las Vegas back in January, Oli also goes on to reveal his struggles with identity issues and self-confidence.

Oli says ”I had so many insecurities when I was younger, I would hate looking in the mirror. I would make myself throw up so I wouldn’t have to go to school. I was extremely insecure”.

He goes on to explain that his love of K-Pop and changing his image to replicate Jimin makes him happy and gives him confidence.

Since he first came to the public spotlight the British man has launched his own K-Pop career, getting millions of views on his music videos, over 75 million views on TikTok and even getting 4 top 40 singles on the itunes K-Pop chart. However, many K-Pop fans are at odds with the controversial star’s obsession with wanting to look like Jimin and he is a regular target of trolls online.

Oli is also set to appear in a new BBC series ‘Too Fat, Too Ugly, Too Asian’ which premiers August 12 on BBC 3.
