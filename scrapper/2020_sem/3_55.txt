For nearly a decade now, SOPHIE’s experimental and hyperkinetic-pop sound has intrigued listeners since early Soundcloud cuts like “Bipp” and “Lemonade.” Now, the reclusive singer-songwriter-producer makes her way into the K-pop scene.

On March 1, girl group ITZY shared the tracklist and production credits to their upcoming It'z Me EP revealing that SOPHIE had worked on a new track called "24Hrs." Crafted with alt-pop singer Lola Blanc with K-indie singer-rapper Penomeco writing the lyrics, a short instrumental clip that ITZY shared hints to a strong electronic track. The sound is reminiscent of recent SOPHIE tracks like “Ponyboy” or “Faceshopping”—some of the more intense tracks on her Grammy-nominated Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides album—and sounds like a nice fit for the K-pop quintet who have pushed a strong, independent image in tracks like “Dalla Dalla” and “Want It?”

While SOPHIE’s forward-thinking pop sound sounds like it’d be a natural fit for the genre-agnostic K-pop world, “24Hrs” will mark the first time she ventures onto a release. While she's lent her style to major names like Madonna and Charli XCX, plus working on one track for J-pop diva Namie Amuro in 2015, it will be exciting to see if this can lead SOPHIE and/or her publishing team to more K-pop collaborations.

Additionally exciting is seeing a trans artist embraced when there’s still very little representation for LGBTQ+ artists in the K-pop scene and gay rights are essentially nonexistent in South Korea. SOPHIE’s production work follows right after Troye Sivan and singer-songwriter Leland worked on a track on BTS’ new Map of the Soul : 7 album in another moment of queer representation in K-pop.

ITZY’s It'z Me EP drops on March 9, local time in Korea, that will also feature the lead single “Wannabe” and a collaboration with EDM producer Oliver Heldens “Ting Ting Ting.”
