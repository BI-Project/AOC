The producers of “KPOP” have moved their casting search online as they prepare for a Broadway run next season.

The musical, originally seen Off-Broadway with a book by Jason Kim, music and lyrics by Helen Park and Max Vernon and direction by Teddy Bergman, will host an online virtual call seeking performers. Producers Tim Forbes and Joey Parnes had previously announced a nationwide casting search for a work session in November 2019.

The show, conceived by Kim and Woodshed Collective, premiered Off-Broadway in 2017.
