K-pop girl group ELRIS has made a comeback with the new album "JACKPOT" after adding two new members to the group.



The agency Hunus Entertainment said earlier this month that the group recruited two new members ― EJ and Chaejeong ― and would be releasing its fourth album as a seven-member outfit. 



The new album is dance-pop genre, with the concept of tough teen girls, which is a change from the group's previous bright, sparkly images. 



The group originally planned to hold a media showcase on the album's release day. But the agency called it off Tuesday due to the coronavirus spike in the country. 



Instead, the group decided to hold a fan event through streaming platform V Live on the day. 



ELRIS debuted in 2017 with five members ― Bella, Hyesung, Yukyung, Sohee and Karin. Sohee's debut drew interest because she was a semifinalist in SBS's popular audition show "K-pop Star" season 6. 



The latest album was released at 6 p.m. Wednesday through online streaming sites.
