For many adults, the members of the world’s best ever band are John, Paul, George and Ringo.

But if you were to ask a teenager the same question today, they might well reply: Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook.

For those unfamiliar, these young men are members of BTS - a South Korean pop group who sold out Wembley stadium last summer and became the first band since the Beatles to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200 chart in less than a year.

And they can dance.

In fact, their dance moves alone are so popular, that a new wave of classes have sprung up around the country specifically for people who want to emulate their K-Pop idols, and some industry insiders say it could become as popular as ballet or tap.

Louise Quan, 32, founded Love K-Pop Dance London 18 months ago and now hosts two classes a week at Base Dance Studios in Vauxhall. They are almost always oversubscribed.

“We have a capacity of 30 in the class, but there can sometimes be another 30 on the waiting list,” she said.

The crowd is “mostly female” and mostly aged between 18 and 30.
