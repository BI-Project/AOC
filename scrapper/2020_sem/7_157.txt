It’s honestly kind of amazing how TikTokers can come up with catchy dance moves to songs. They’re SO good that I find myself doing the “Savage” dance in the shower sometimes. No shame here, folks. I know y’all can definitely relate.

On this episode of TikTok Challenge Challenge, we got K-pop boy band

Tomorrow x Together to try to learn some of those viral dances like the one to Megan Thee Stallion’s hit. But the catch? They gotta get them down in just…60 seconds.

The first member to give it a go was Beomgyu, who, um, totally crushed it?! His practice round was already impressive, but the final performance had my jaw drop. The! Effort! Soobin was the next contestant and he was pretty stellar too. My dude even added some of his own extra moves into the mix. We love some originality!

For Yeonjun, we gave him a dance that involved a lottt of hip movement. And you probs won’t be surprised when I tell you that Taehyun and Hueningkai also slayed the choreo we had them do. Boy bands, they can do it all!

Be sure to watch till the end to find out who won and also try out the TikTok dance they created for their single “Can’t You See Me?” out now!
