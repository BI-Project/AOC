My introduction to the ocean of K-pop began when a friend introduced me to a Chinese drama where one of the leads is a member of a C-pop/K-pop group. After watching a few compilation videos of him with his members, I became a casual fan. But what non-fans donâ€™t know is that the industry is so intertwined that it is impossible to not discover other groups or new idols. One of the other members eventually debuted with another group and watching his new videos introduced me to 10 other idols who were from different agencies and were in turn connected to even more idols. Before I knew it, I had already mastered multi-tasking by crying over 10 boys daily.
