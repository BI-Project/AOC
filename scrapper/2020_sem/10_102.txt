Your 1st single album ‘THE FIRST STEP : CHAPTER ONE’ launched on 7th August 2020. How do you think the album captures your group's aesthetic and essence?

Well, we are still in the process of defining the true essence of TREASURE! In our first album, we tried to mix the original vibe of YG with a twist of our own distinct styles. We really tried our best to make our music more approachable to various listeners in a way that they could see our charm and potential.

Since there are so many of us, we hope that our listeners can experience the many different sides of TREASURE and the dynamics in our choreography! We think that ‘BOY’ is a song that really emphasizes our diversity!

Was the preparation very intensive for your first single album debut?

Since it was our debut album, we really put in a lot of hard work and effort into finishing it! We spent most of our time in the studio recording and practising until everything was perfect. We knew that a lot of our fans were eagerly waiting for our debut, so we uploaded several cover song/dance videos to show them a snippet of what we had in store.

We would like to thank all our fans who have patiently waited for the album and have given us support throughout the process!
