SM Entertainment’s new Kpop girl group Aespa is finally here, with their debut song “Black Mamba”.

When SM Entertainment first made the announcement launch on October 26, we know they are definitely something to watch out for.

Comprised of members Karina, Giselle, Winter and NingNing, Aespa is the SM Entertainment’s newest girl group since the launch of Red Velvet in 2014. The name Aespa came from a concept of seeing the world through an avatar counterpart of yourself, combining ae which means “Avatar X Experience” and the English word “concept”.

Arguably, the song is catchy and the vibe of showing an ethereal beauty in the world of virtual reality is definitely a powerful draw for the expecting fans.

While there are no further announcements made by the group yet, be sure to check out their “Black Mamba” music video:
