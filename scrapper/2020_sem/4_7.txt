The album, titled "Chromatica," has a track titled "Sour Candy," which features none other than the queens of Blackpink.

Blackpink -- which consists of members Jennie, Lisa, Ros√© and Jisoo -- has consistently dominated the music charts not only in South Korea, but also in the US , with hits like "Kill This Love" and "DDU-DU-DDU-DU."

Gaga's new 16-track album also includes "Stupid Love," which has already been released, and a song featuring Elton John called "Sine From Above." Another song, titled "Rain On Me," features Ariana Grande.

But many people sounding off in response to Gaga's tweet appear to be big Blackpink fans.
