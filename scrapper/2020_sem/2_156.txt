Organisers cite virus concerns, no word yet on shows by K-pop queen Taeyon

The South Korean supergroup GOT7 has cancelled two concerts in Bangkok due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

Organisers 4NOLOGUE said the postponement of the “Keep Spinning” world tour dates scheduled for Feb 15 and 16 at Rajamangala National Stadium were for the safety of the artists and fans in light of global worries about the virus.

The decision had been reached after talks with their management, JYP Entertainment, in Seoul.

“4NOLOGUE is fully aware that all of the fans have been waiting and preparing everything to participate in the shows. However, the safety and health of the audiences and artists is our top priority,” the organisers said in a Facebook message, citing “coronavirus proliferation concerns”.

New dates for the concerts in the Thai capital have not been set.

The band also cancelled a Singapore show scheduled for Feb 22 for the same reasons.

Meanwhile, fans of K-pop queen Taeyeon are awaiting word on whether her shows scheduled for Feb 22 and 23 at Thunder Dome Muang Thong Thani will go ahead.

She postponed her concert in Singapore on Saturday, also because of concerns about the virus. SM True, which is organising the shows for “The Unseen” tour, has not posted any updates since a Jan 10 Facebook message about her solo tour in Thailand.
