“Everyone is on their phones and social media more than they’ve ever been before. It’s so easy to be malicious and negative online because you’re hidden behind a monitor. But it’s so easy to be positive as well. My intention with ‘Gunshot’ was to show what the bad side could do. On the other side of your comment, you don’t know that someone is hurt. You don’t know that they could be going through something awful. Making someone aware of that was my No. 1 intention. People used to say ‘sticks and stones…’ and all that, but now, I disagree with that. Especially with the younger generation. Words are knives and bullets. That’s why I wanted to name the song ‘Gunshot.’
