But social media has bolstered progressive campaigns within Korean culture, too. The #MeToo movement has targeted powerful men, most notably the Korean film director Kim Ki-duk (on a 2018 South Korean news show, several actors accused him of sexual abuse, but Kim denied the accusations). The behemoth industry that is K-pop remains less affected by the #MeToo movement, but social media has provided positive platforms for young Korean women.

Following Naeun's phone-case scandal, her female and feminist fans showed support on Twitter with the hashtag #girlscandoanything, which started trending in Korea. And fans on social media are some of the most outspoken when it comes to K-pop's infamous no-dating rule, a clause in many idols' contracts that forbids them from being in a relationship. K-pop devotees are often cited as the reason for the ban in the first place (to preserve the fantasy of idols being single), but many have urged labels to ease up on this outdated rule.

K-pop's stars rarely speak out about negative experiences, but a handful of ex-idols have used social media to reveal a dark underbelly. One YouTuber, Maydoni, for example, has opened up about sleazy older men who surrounded her during idol training. A present-day idol has yet to use social media in a major way to expose K-pop's seedier side, but we've seen how hordes of fans can mobilize through the internet. Perhaps change lies with them. What is K-pop, after all, without its fans?
