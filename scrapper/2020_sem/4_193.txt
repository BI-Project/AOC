Apink’s new song “Dumhdurum” took our chart by storm this week, debuting all the way at No. 1! This song also swept with wins on all music shows. Congratulations to Apink!

“Dumhdurum” is the title song from Apink’s ninth mini album “LOOK.” The dance track has an addictive chorus and a memorable synth lead in the hook. “Dumhdurum” is a new word to describe feeling calm.

ITZY’s “WANNABE” proves its longevity as it moves back up one spot to No. 2 this week. Rounding out the top three is (G)I-DLE’s “Oh my god,” down one spot to No. 3.
