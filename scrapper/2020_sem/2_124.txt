Among the audience members were Jan Domingo and Chai Jackson who said: “We love K-pop!”

Domingo said she would like to see more K-pop entertainers performing on Saipan.

“Next time, we should have a bigger stage for them,” said Michelle Palig, another audience member.

The free concert started at 7 p.m. and featured the girl group LikeMe, hip-hop rappers Mino and Byungyun, and the Breakers, a boy group.

Businessman Hong Kyun Kim invited the Korean entertainers to the island for the opening of International Roller Skates at the Winners Residence in San Antonio.

“The turnout was very great,” he said, as he thanked community members for enjoying the free concert, which was sponsored by the Saipan Korean Cultural Center, Hyatt Regency Saipan, and International Roller Skates.

International Roller Skates gift certificates were given away to the first 200 members of the audience.

There was also a raffle drawing for prizes that included a one-night stay at Hyatt Regency Saipan and lunch at its Miyako and Giovanni’s Restaurants.
