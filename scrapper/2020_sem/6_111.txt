Samsung Galaxy Buds+ BTS Edition will come with a vibrant look for K-pop fans

At the Galaxy Unpacked event earlier this year, Samsung unveiled a new pair of truly wireless (TWS) earbuds alongside its flagship Galaxy S20 series. The new earbuds, called the Samsung Galaxy Buds+, were a minor upgrade over the original Galaxy Buds, featuring larger batteries in the earbuds as well as the charging case, support for multi-device connection, and a new dual driver system. Initially, the Buds+ were released in three color variants — Cosmic Black, Cosmic Blue, and Black — but Samsung went on to add a new red color, a special Thom Browne edition, and an Aura Blue color. Now, Samsung is working on a BTS-branded Galaxy Buds+ that will cater to K-pop fans.

XDA Editor-in-Chief Mishaal Rahman and XDA TV Video Producer Max Weinbach had originally spotted that Samsung was working on a new purple-colored Galaxy Buds+ that would go on sale alongside a BTS-branded Mirror Purple Samsung Galaxy S20+.

These Mirror Purple BTS-branded Buds+ were then leaked by Evan ‘evleaks’ Blass from all angles, on his Patreon.

Evan has also posted the retail packaging and the BTS-adorned marketing material for the wireless earbuds from Samsung.

The Galaxy Buds+ BTS Edition will be launching alongside the Samsung Galaxy S20+ BTS Edition on July 7.

BTS is a seven-member South Korean boy band which is immensely popular among fans of the K-pop (Korean Pop) genre. The band has fans not only in South Korea, but all across the world, thanks to their works as well as collaborations with other international pop artists like Halsey, Ed Sheeran, Nicki Minaj, The Chainsmokers, and many others. A BTS-branded Galaxy S20+ and Buds+ attempts to capitalize on the fandom while still introducing a different color option on the already-popular products.
