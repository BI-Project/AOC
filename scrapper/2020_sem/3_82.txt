TZUYU, a member of the wildly popular K-pop group Twice, drew flak from Chinese mainlanders when she donated 50 million won (RM175,590) to a community chest in South Korea to help fight Covid-19.



Critics were unhappy that Tzuyu, 21, had not donated to China where the outbreak was far worse than other countries, Oriental Daily reported.



However, other netizens defended Tzuyu, who was born in Taiwan.



According to them, Tzuyu lives and works in South Korea, so it was only right for her to make such donations.



Tzuyu’s agency JYP Entertainment explained that the donation was meant to help frontline medical staff.
