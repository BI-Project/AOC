Dubbed 2020 Kang Daniel 1st Anniversary Ontact Fan Meeting "Dan1tyst", the event will commemorate the first anniversary of Kang’s solo debut. The word "ontact" is said to be derived from “online” and “untact”, meaning non-face-to-face.

KiosTix.com chief growth officer of Andhika Soetalaksana hoped the fan meeting would entertain those who had longed for K-pop events amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
