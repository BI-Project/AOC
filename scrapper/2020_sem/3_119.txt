Stray Kids have cancelled their 2020 Europe tour amid the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak.

The boy group were due to perform in Madrid, Berlin, London, Brussels, Paris and Moscow in May.

The K-pop stars would have played at London’s Wembley Arena on 17 May as part of their District 9: Unlock in Europe tour.

Their agency JYP Entertainment released a statement on Tuesday apologising to the fandom, called Stay, for the cancellations.

In a notice written in Korean and English, JYPE said: ‘Stray Kids World Tour “District 9: Unlock in EUROPE scheduled for May, 2020 at Madrid, Berlin, London, Brussels, Paris, Moscow has unfortunately been cancelled due to the recent proliferation of the COVID-19.

‘We ask for your understanding as this decision has been made in consideration for the safety of the artists and the audience.

‘We sincerely apologise to all fans who anticipated Stray Kids’ concert’.

Stray Kids were put together on a survival show and debuted in 2018 with nine members – Woojin, Bang Chan, Lee Know, Hyunjin, Changbin, Han, Seungmin, Felix and I.N. They went on to release tracks such as MIROH, My Pace and Double Knot.

Last year Woojin left the group for personal reasons.

Recently K-pop groups Seventeen and AB6IX also axed their tours in Europe.
