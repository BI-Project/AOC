Streaming giant YouTube will release the first documentary on a K-pop girl group through YouTube Originals this month. 



"TWICE: Seize the Light," an eight-episode documentary about nine-member group TWICE, will be available through the platform on April 29 to more than 80 countries.



The documentary will follow the group's K-pop career, including the members' journey to making their debut as trainees.



It will also give a closer look into the group's first North American Tour, which was part of "TWICE WOLRD TOUR 2019 'TWICELIGHTS.'"



TWICE debuted in 2015 through Mnet's audition program "Sixteen" which hosted JYP Entertainment's trainees competing to make it into the debut group. 



The group shot to stardom in the following years, releasing hits like "Like OOH-AHH" (2015), "LIKEY" (2017) and "FANCY" (2019).



As a promotion for the documentary, the group will hold a fan event "Premiere Live Stream" at 2 p.m. on April 28 to interact with global fans through the platform.
