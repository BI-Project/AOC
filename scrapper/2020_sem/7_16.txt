ICYMI, Doordarshan recently delighted K-Pop fans in India as they aired a song called Be The Future featuring bands like Dreamcatcher, AleXa and IN2IT. The song was an attempt by the Korean artists to create a track that reflected the difficulties people are facing due to Covid-19 and how to adapt to them.

After the song was played on DD, fans of all the K-Pop bands like BTS, EXO, Blackpink and many more flooded the micro-blogging site with several tweets and begged the broadcasting network to play more Korean content.

It all started after a Twitter account called Korean Culture India FC posted a clip of the song playing on Doordarshan channel. They tweeted the video saying, "Omg! Be the future ft. Alexa, IN2IT & DREAMCATCHER was aired on Doordarshan!! One of the first and oldest Indian tv channels that's huge! Thank you @DDNational!
