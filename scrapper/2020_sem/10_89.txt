BTS fans, collectively known as ARMY, are fuming after two Filipino rappers allegedly plagiarized one of the Kpop boyband’s rap songs.

The fans’ objects of scorn are Flow G and Skusta Clee, members of Ex-Battalion, the group responsible for the viral earworm “Hayaan Mo Sila” (“Let Them Be”). According to the ARMY, the two rappers’ song “DEYM,” which was used to promote a Filipino clothing brand last month, is a carbon copy of the 2018 BTS song “Ddaeng.”

BTS fans have been tweeting online to urge other ARMYs to report the Pinoy rappers’ song to the boyband’s management company, Big Hit Entertainment.

Someone using the handle @stigmandi wrote, “hi armys!! please help us to report the song ‘deym’ by flow g ft. skusta clee because they plagiarized BTS’ Ddaeng. pls report the youtube vid and email bighit. thankyou!”

Another fan named @deslubernalte was far less chirpy, tweeting, “please fire Skusta clee & flow G from their career, for dis-respecting BTS, please let them go to Jail.”

BTS fan @beemyhope_ chimed in and wrote, “the audacity of these filipino men who keep dragging down kpop artists specially bts and keep saying ‘sUpPoRt LocAlS’ when they straightly plagiarised DDAENG by bts’ rapline. yes i’m talking to you SKUSTA CLEE, FLOW G and your entire PRODUCTION TEAM.”

This is not the first time that Ex-Battalion members were accused of plagiarism. In 2018, they allegedly copied Diamond Style’s “One Kiss” for “Hayaan Mo Sila,” but the group insisted that they paid for the beat.
