"For the past few weeks, our team...[has] been anxiously monitoring the progress of the situation with the nCoV virus. With the number of infected people increasing by the day (currently at 24,000) and death toll already at 500, there is no sign of [the spread of the virus] slowing down with still too much uncertainty on the current and upcoming situation.
