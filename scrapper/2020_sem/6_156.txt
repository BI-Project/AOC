After BTS' Jungkook released his first solo single "Still With You" during the boy band's famous Festa 2020, fans want to hear their other favorite K-pop group members take the mic by themselves.

Since Suga's D-2 mixtape debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 last week (chart dated June 6), the remaining BTS members -- V, Jimin, Jin, RM and J-Hope -- might want to get back to working on their own projects. Wonho, formerly of Monsta X, signed with Highline Entertainment in April to officially embark on his solo career, and the Monsta X fanbase, known as Monbebe, can't wait to hear his first new music.

Blackpink just announced the girl group's comeback single will arrive later this month, but their four solo ventures are trailing behind, according to Soompi. After Jennie's first-ever "Solo" stunt back in 2018, YG Entertainment plans on dropping Rosé’s first single, which has been in the works for over a year, right after the September-slated release of Blackpink's first-ever full studio album. Lisa and Jisoo are also preparing to release their individual projects.
