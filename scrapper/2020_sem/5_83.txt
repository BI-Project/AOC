KPOP the musical made its Broadway debut after receiving raving reviews from its first performances at the off-Broadway Ars Nova theatre, located in Hell’s Kitchen New York City. The show performed for the first time in September, 2017 and was created by a number of artists who have little to no experience working on any production for The Great White Way. Even though the production team may lack Broadway exposure, the musical was written by the South Korean film writer and director Jason Kim. Some NYC based theatre companies, the Woodshed Collective and the Ma-Yi Theater Company helped out in their respective fields. Music and lyrics for this show were written and designed both by Helen Park and Max Vernon. Vernon has worked on previous Off-Broadway shows, like The View UpStairs, and has been described as an equal mix of “bohemia and Broadway”. Teddy Bergman is the director of KPOP and he is the only person who has worked on any Broadway show before, as.Bergman previously performed in the Peter and the Starcatcher, which performed at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre throughout 2012, in the supporting role of Fighting Prawn.



KPOP was in its production phase during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic and was the first Broadway show to host its casting auditions virtually, through online video calls.
