While in New York City for the first stop on the American leg of their District 9: Unlock Tour, K-pop group Stray Kids stopped by the Allure office to share some quick tidbits about their beauty routines for an "Ask Allure" segment on our Instagram Story.

Spoiler: Members Han and Felix broke down every single step of their nighttime skin-care routines. (You'll have to stay tuned for what Bang Chan, Changbin, I.N, Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Seungmin revealed.)

Before I get into their steps, I'll note the boys couldn't get specific about the exact products they use. Like the majority of K-pop stars I interview, they can't share product names as they don't want to lose out on future endorsement deals. It's a whole thing.

All that aside, Han prefaces the list of what he uses on a nightly basis: "My skin-care routine is fast," he says. First, he washes his face. â€œI take my lotion and put it on my face," he explains. And lastly, he gets a good night's sleep. That's it.

Felix notes how simple Han is in his approach to skin care before launching into his own much-more-involved routine. Felix kicks off his regimen with double cleansing, starting with an oil cleanser to dissolve his makeup. Then, Felix washes it off with warm water and follows with a cleansing foam. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Double cleansing is the best possible way to remove makeup, so I respect that he takes all the right steps. The Then I Met You Cleansing Duo is my personal go-to for this part of my routine.

After he rinses the cleansing foam with warm water, things get complex. If I had more time with Stray Kids, I would ask Felix for more information about each of the following steps. Here's what he did share in a minute, though: "I put on three kinds of creams."
