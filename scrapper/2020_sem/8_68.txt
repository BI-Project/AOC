South Korean singer BoA will celebrate the 20th anniversary of her debut in music by holding a livestreaming event.

Dubbed BoA Still Our No. 1, the event will take place on Aug. 25 at 6:25 p.m. local time on VLIVE.

The singer, who made her debut in 2000 with album ID; Peace B under entertainment agency SM Entertainment, will also hold a question-and-answer and sharing session with her fans during the virtual event.

In July, the agency’s digital music project SM Station announced a special album, Our Beloved BoA, featuring performers who covered BoA’s hit numbers. As reported by Allkpop, they are EXO’s Baekhyun with “Garden in the Air”, Bolbbalgan4 with “Atlantis Princes”, Gallant with “Only One”, Red Velvet with “Milky Way” and SM Classics with “Tree”.

BoA’s second album, No. 1 (2002), was named among the best-selling records of the year in Korea by the Recording Industry Association of Korea with more than 500,000 copies sold. The album includes one of her most popular songs, “No. 1”.

The 33-year old singer is one of the first Korean performers whose fame expanded to Japan as her Japanese debut album Listen to My Heart (2002) debuted at number one on the country's Oricon Chart in that year. (wir/wng)
