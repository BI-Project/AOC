For the uninformed, BlackPink is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa.

In the now-viral tweet, PUBG has shared a pink colour-themed graphic featuring a girl with bangs, pink hair, pink glasses and reflective sunglasses. As you look closely at the reflection of the glasses, the battleground is clearly visible.

PUBG Mobile has asked players to guess who is featuring in the caption of the tease. Captioning the tweet, they said, “Guess who is coming.”

Soon after, users started guessing as to which Blackpink member she is! Fans are confused whether it’s Lalisa Manoban, who is popularly known as Lisa or Jennie.

Interestingly, Lisa is the brand ambassador of the Brawl Star game, which is also Tencent’s game.

However, the news might not bring any excitement for fans in India, because the Indian government had banned the popular game on September 2, along with other 117 Chinese mobile applications.

Meanwhile, PUBG is trying to lift the ban and is cutting ties with China’s Tencent Games in India.
