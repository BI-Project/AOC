• There's a new meme on Twitter that involves juxtaposing a character or public figure's torso alongside a pair of legs wearing thigh-high boots.
• The legs in question belong to Lisa, a member of K-pop girl group Blackpink.
• People are using various screencaps of her legs from a recent dance performance video to spice up characters like Spock or Captain America.

Step aside — there's a new pair of perfect legs in town and they're dominating the Twitter meme cycle. A recent meme has catapulted a pair of thigh-high-adorned legs into Twitter stardom by juxtaposing them against a variety of torsos, making it appear as if people like the late Leonard Nimoy's Spock or animated character Bojack Horseman are sporting some new, out-of-character limbs.

The legs in question belong to Lisa, a member of K-pop girl group Blackpink, who performed at Coachella in 2019 and is set to appear on a track on Lady Gaga's upcoming "Chromatica." The youngest member (23), a rapper, and main dancer in the group, Lisa is known for her electric dance performances: a fancam of her performing a dance cover to Jason Derulo's "Swalla" at a Blackpink concert has over 8 million views on YouTube, and one Twitter video of the performance has nearly 10 million. These particular photos of Lisa's legs are screencaps from a video released on April 20 in which she dances to "Mushroom Chocolate" by QUIN and 6LACK.

Between the thigh-high boots, black shorts, and neutral background, the legs have been a hit across Twitter. While there are certain screencaps of the video that are used more frequently in memes — notably, those in which Lisa is laying on the ground — people have been getting creative in order to get her legs to mash-up with their favorite personalities or characters. Some of the most viral involve characters whose nature unexpectedly vibes with Lisa's legs (we see you, Luigi).Others look contemplative and cool with a pair of neat thigh-highs.

Some celebs got in on the action, memeing themselves with a pair of Lisa's legs. Some pulled it off better than others.

Some brought in pairs of characters, like Captain America and Spider-Man from the MCU or Jon Hamm and Paul Chahidi as Gabriel and Sandalphon in "Good Omens," mixing up the shots of Lisa's legs in the process.

As the meme began to circulate more, however, people started relying on the legs' notoriety online, posting nonsensical and absurd combinations of images that were just as funny as the original memes themselves. For example, one features a recent headline from The Verge that reads, "Elon Musk says shelter-in-place orders during COVID-19 are 'fascist.'"
