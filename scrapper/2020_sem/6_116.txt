Secret Number ― the first K-pop girl band with an Indonesian member ― has become the talk of the town just a few weeks after its debut.

 The music video of the five-piece act's debut track "Who Dis?" ― which was unveiled on May 19 ― had exceeded 12 million views as of Sunday. It took only 10 hours for the clip to garner one million hits, according to the group's agency Vine Entertainment, Friday. 

 

 "Many of the band's YouTube videos, including its pre-debut clips, have surpassed one million views," the agency said. 



Indonesian member Dita is believed to have contributed to the group's quick rise. Dita, who is of Balinese descent, was already thriving on social media before her debut, as she interacted with her followers as a K-pop idol trainee.



When Secret Number's debut was officially announced on May 6, a wave of K-pop fans in Indonesia ― where K-pop is attaining considerable popularity ― and the local media outlets wildly welcomed the emergence of the first K-pop girl band with an Indonesian member. 



"I heard from my family that my debut created a buzz in Indonesia," Dita said during the group's debut showcase on May 19 in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. "I will do my best not to fail people." 

 Secret Number, comprising Jinny, Denise, Soodam, Lea and Dita, initially planned to make its debut on March 26, but it was delayed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
