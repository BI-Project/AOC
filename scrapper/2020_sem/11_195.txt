The Korean-American teenager Candace Park downplays her K-pop fangirling, because “isn’t it so expected for the Korean girl to be super into K-pop?” So when the world’s biggest K-pop label holds auditions for its new girl group in her home state of New Jersey and she tries out on a whim, she’s shocked to be chosen for the trainee program. Though the odds of making the final cut are slim, she heads to Seoul, where she endures four months of grueling workouts, dance practices and Korean language classes. A secret crush on a cute boy and the tantalizing promise of stardom make the harsh criticism and scarce sleep bearable. But as the deadline for the final audition looms, she finds her sense of self challenged in ways she didn’t expect and doesn’t agree with. When Candace finally puts her stiletto heel down, the crack is heard round the K-pop world, resulting in a nail-biting climax that plays out thrillingly until the very last page. Lee’s Cinderella story, set to a pulsing soundtrack of Blackpink and Red Velvet, is the delectable K-pop confessional we’ve all been waiting for. Full of bright lights, big cities and glamorous photo shoots, the novel also delves into the dark side of the glitter: stalker fans, brutal social media backlash, and K-pop idol factories that churn out Instagram-ready groups who sacrifice any semblance of a normal life for a chance at fame. But it’s seeing Seoul through the eyes of Candace, an American who has to learn the rules and manners of her own cultural heritage like a tourist, that provides the rich flavor of this frothy bubble tea of a book. Sprinkled throughout with the names of current bands and songs, it’s best enjoyed before the K pops.
