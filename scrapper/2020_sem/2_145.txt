Samsung announced that it has signed a partnership with K-pop royalty BTS, according to a Yonhap News Agency report.

The company will start by collaborating with BTS for the group's global contemporary art initiative Connect BTS, which was designed to create art projects involving the group's philosophy for love and diversity in five cities namely London, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul and New York.

Samsung will reportedly support the augmented reality (AR) aspects of the initiative, where BTS members are said to appear and talk to fans about the art pieces in a virtual setting.

"We hope we can deliver a good experience to fans of BTS and Galaxy devices around the globe through collaboration with BTS. We are planning various activities other than Connect BTS," a Samsung official said in the Yonhap report.

While the company did not share any other details about the BTS partnership, the report stated that industry experts believe the group will join Samsung's promotion and marketing events for the newly-launched Galaxy S20 flagship series.

Website All-Kpop reported that some eagle-eyed fans at the Galaxy Unpacked event in the United States spotted BTS member V (real name Kim Tae-hyung) in a promotional video for the Galaxy S20 smartphone.

The news also made Samsung a trending topic on Twitter today (Feb 19) with more than 100,000 tweets and counting, especially among the huge BTS Army (what the fans call themselves) fanbase.

For example, one BTS Army Twitter account based in South Korea has around 4.2 million followers. BTS' verified Twitter account itself has 24 million followers.

Fans speculated that Samsung may release special edition BTS-themed mobile devices and wearables, just like the company did with current brand ambassadors K-pop girl group Blackpink.

The Star has reached out to Samsung for more information.
