The pandemic continues to put plans on pause. Changmin, a member of South Korean pop duo TVXQ, has pushed back his wedding.

Also known by his stage name Max Changmin, the 32-year-old was reported to be marrying his non-celebrity girlfriend. He had announced the news in a handwritten letter to fans in June and TVXQ's management agency SM Entertainment also confirmed it in a statement.

However, on Thursday (Aug 27), the agency said the wedding, originally scheduled to take place on Sept 5, has been postponed. The decision was made following a recent surge in Covid-19 cases in South Korea.

According to South Korean entertainment news portal Soompi, SM Entertainment cited "concerns over the spread of Covid-19" and said the singer is planning on a "new date following discussions with (his and his fiancee's) families". â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network
