The Billboard-chart-topping act is aiming worldwide with their new music to 'present the next level of K-pop.'

With No. 1s across Korea, Japan, the Billboard charts and beyond, TWICE is already one of K-pop's international leaders and now the girl group is looking even more worldwide with one of the biggest U.S. labels helping them.

Billboard can exclusively reveal the first details between a new strategic partnership between Korean superlabel JYP Entertainment and the top label on Billboard's 2019 year-end charts Republic Records.

While JYP is home to several beloved K-pop stars -- including singer-producer J.Y. Park who is also the company's namesake, fellow girl group ITZY, boy bands 2PM, GOT7 and Stray Kids, K-pop/rock outfit DAY6 and more -- TWICE will be first artist to be powered under the alliance.
