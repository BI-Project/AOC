K-pop shows happening in the UK in 2020

BTS, SuperM, Seventeen & AB6IX come to the UK this year

The popularity of Korean pop – or in its bitty form, K-pop – has expanded far beyond the continent from whence it came in recent years. Phrases like 'taken the world by storm' and 'global phenomenon' aptly describe the genre's surge. Rappers like Kanye West, Missy Elliot and Snoop Dogg have collaborated on tracks with K-pop groups, confirming the genre has firmly cemented itself into Western culture.

The UK has hosted a number of K-pop shows of late, with more Korean stars coming every year. In 2019, supergroup BTS made their first UK appearance at Wembley Stadium, performing for 90,000 fans and in 2020 some will follow suit. Here's a list of all the K-pop tours and shows happening in the UK in 2020. Keep checking back as the more will be added throughout the year.

AB6IX members Lin Ying, Tian Xiong, Jin Dongxian, Park Youjun and Li Dahui released their hugely successful debut album 6IXENSE back in October 2019. The record topped the Korean Album Chart upon release and bagged the group eight accolades, including the Golden Disc Award for Next Generation Artists. Now the group is jet-setting across the globe to perform music from their debut album to adoring fans, including a February show in London.
