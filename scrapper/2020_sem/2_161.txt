Self-love comes in many shapes and forms. The key to achieving it is to practice mindfulness, to accept that we are human, and to realize that we’re enough as such. Many idols without a doubt have addressed this matter many times in their songs and felt the need to emphasize the importance of self-love and how we perceive ourselves.

Here are seven K-pop songs that tackle the topic of self-love in depth.

In this moving ballad, Taeyeon reminisces about the hard times she once endured and writes her future self a letter filled with messages of liberation, self-love, and endless support. She also asks to be reminded of these words whenever she hits a rough patch and feels like hiding again.

SF9 goes above and beyond in this track to highlight the importance of accepting one’s beauty. Their lyrics boost confidence and charmingly compliment natural beauty, stating that we are beautiful just the way we are and that it’s enough.

Moonbyul and Seulgi join their voices to declare that selfishness is not always a bad thing. Instead of being a people-pleaser and being hard on yourself to meet others’ standards, you should be honest with yourself and make your own choices.

Nothing screams motivation like a fast-tempo track from Stray Kids! The group pinpoints that jealousy and comparison are meaningless and that only you can get your happiness by carrying on at your own pace. Remember, just because you rush things doesn’t mean you’ll reach your goals faster!

When was the last time you said no? CLC delivers a strong statement about speaking their minds and objecting to comments that don’t line up with their personal preferences. Staying true to ourselves no matter how much others try to mold us is a daily challenge that we learn to overcome with time.

Jin takes us on a journey of self-realization, where he makes a stop at all the red flags that keep one’s true self buried.
