BT21, the character IP co-created by Line Friends and BTS, has inspired two new ranges of character IPs with ITZY and Treasure. In partnership with both groups, Line Friends will bring fresher takes on its character IP business by maximizing fandom engagement from the initial level of character development.

A global character brand, Line Friends is pushing the boundaries of character IP business by bringing new, unprecedented types of collaboration with global artists.

Line Friends is moving beyond the conventional character business and broadening its horizons. Building upon the BT21 momentum, Line Friends is now ready to bring fresher takes with two rising K-pop supergroups, Itzy and Treasure, by driving fan engagement.

Itzy, a five-member girl group from JYP Entertainment who debuted in 2019, is creating its own unique characters embodying the identity of “lifelong friends,” from drawing sketches to detailing the characteristics, preferences and values. Midzy, the fandom, is joining the journey toward this character IP development, given the opportunities to share creative ideas on their social media platforms.

For Treasure, a 12-member rookie boy band from YG Entertainment, Line Friends will bring into play interactive gaming factors from the initial stage of the character development. With the support of Treasure Maker, the fandom, Treasure members will be completing gaming quests to design the appearance, personality and capability of their unique characters.

The full making process of Itzy and Treasure characters can be viewed at Line Friend’s official YouTube channel.
