In addition to being quite possibly the most devoted fan base in the world, K-Pop lovers clearly have much better organisational skills than the rest of us. Since the Black Lives Matter movement experienced a resurgence following the death of George Floyd, K-Pop stans have flooded the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag with images of their favourite musicians, blocking out racist posts in the process – while BTS’s followers have raised more than a million dollars for BLM after the band tweeted out its support for the movement (and made its own sizeable donation to boot).

The K-pop vigilantes latest effort? Derailing a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in defiance of white supremacy. President Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale had projected that the 19,000-seat BOK Center would be full (with overflowing crowds lining up outside) on 20 June, but in reality, less than 7,000 people turned up – forcing the President to cancel an additional planned speech. It appears K-Pop fans (and Alt TikTok users) had reserved tickets to the event with no intention of going, considerably skewing Parscale’s numbers. Notably, the rally had been widely criticised by supporters of BLM – who cited the historical significance of Juneteenth and the devastating Tulsa Race Massacre as reasons for it not to go ahead.

Taking to Twitter, Parscale claimed the low turnout was due to “radical protestors” who had “blocked access to metal detectors, preventing people from entering”, but the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were quick to contradict him. “Actually you just got ROCKED by teens on TikTok who flooded the Trump campaign w/ fake ticket reservations & tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during COVID,” the Democratic congresswoman replied. “KPop allies, we see and appreciate your contributions in the fight for justice too.”
