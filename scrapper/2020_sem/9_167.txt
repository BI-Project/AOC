SM Entertainment & K-pop all-star group SuperM are teaming up for a collaboration with Marvel! The project, announced ahead of the release of SuperM’s debut full-length album, Super One, includes a SuperM x Marvel limited-edition apparel collection available exclusively for preorder on SuperM’s Official Store. The new initiative serves as a launch point between SME and Marvel to create future SuperM x Marvel co-branded content, products, and live fan experiences spanning the SME portfolio.

Drawn from some of the most popular K-Pop acts in the world, SuperM much like the Avengers is a true dream team with seven members - Taemin from SHINee, EXO’s Baekhyun and Kai, NCT 127's Taeyong and Mark, and Ten and Lucas of Chinese band WayV.

“Marvel has proven itself as a highly influential lifestyle brand with fans who are inspired by the world’s most empowered characters and stories,” Paul Gitter, Senior Vice President, Marvel Licensing, explained in a statement. “Working with SM Entertainment authentically expands the Marvel Universe of products into K-Pop culture in a cool, original way, since the SuperM members are Marvel fans themselves.”
