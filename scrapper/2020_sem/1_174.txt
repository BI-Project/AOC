A K-pop Super Concert presenting five Korean K-pop bands is heading to Dubai on the 20th of March in Dubai’s Coca-Cola Arena.

Super Junior and NCT 127 will be joined by South Korean reggae duo RGP and five-member girl group Laboum and Jun.

They will all be hitting the stage together in the UAE for the first time.

The news came after the venue teased yesterday that a “super event” was coming to Dubai on Friday, March 20, with the hashtag #KpopinUAE.

NCT 127 is the second subunit of boy band NCT, they made history by becoming the first K-pop group to perform at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards in Spain.

Super Junior performed in Saudi Arabia at the Jeddah Season Festival as one of the first K-pop acts to head to the country. Their concert not only sold out but crashed the ticket website an hour later.

The last full-blown K-pop concert was arguably SM Town Live in 2018.

You can register for tickets for the K-pop Super Concert 2020 here. We’re very excited.
