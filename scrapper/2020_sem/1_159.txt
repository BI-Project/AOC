K-pop has come to dominate my workout playlist over the past three years, and I'm not even shocked at this point. If you've ever gone down the K-pop rabbit hole, you understand: the more you look, the more songs you find that have that chef's-kiss perfect combination of intensity and high BPM that make you want to sprint and sprint with the beat pumping nonstop in your ears.

When it comes to cardio, trust me when I say that a solid K-pop playlist will keep you going until you collapse. These are the songs I go to during mile 10 of my long runs, or when the hardest incline section hits on the treadmill, or when my quads are screaming on the bike and I still have 15 minutes to go. Here are 18 of the highest-intensity K-pop tracks I could find, designed to power you through the worst parts of your cardio session. Hit play, swipe up the volume, and take it to the next level.
