Naira Marley’s new signee Lyta has been accused of music video plagiarism by South Korean K-pop fans.

K-pop fans took to social media to decry the uncanny similarities between Nigerian singer’s new video for the song “Hold Me Down” And “Just Right” by South Korean K-pop boy band GOT7.

A Twitter fan page of GOT7 @GOT7_JYP noted the similarity between both videos. “Please take legal action on this. We do not accept plagiarism”, they tweeted and tagged the boy band official Twitter account.

Along with their tweet, the fan page shared a video in which both music videos were placed together.

Lyta’s “Hold Me Down” music video was released yesterday via Naira Marley’s YouTube account.

In the description of the video which has now garnered over 400,000 views, Naira Marley wrote that, “This video was inspired by Kpop Korean boy band GOT7 and BTS.”

Meanwhile, GOT7’s music video for “Right Here” was published on July 12, 2015. The video has been viewed over 335 million times.

Reacting to the accusation, Naira Marley on his Twitter page said:
