G-Dragon, whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong, debuted in 2006 as leader of the K-pop act and has enjoyed enormous global success, especially in Asia, both as part of the group and through solo projects. Following a two-year hiatus spent fulfilling his mandatory military service, G-Dragon quietly resumed his show business career in late 2019.
