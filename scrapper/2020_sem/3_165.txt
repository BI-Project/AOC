Although he has released incredible singles like "Heart Sign," Ong Seong-wu's new album, Layers, will be his first since the disbandment of the Produce 101 supergroup Wanna One in 2019.

Kang Daniel's Cyan will be his first official mini album, too! It follows his 2019 debut release, Color on Me, which broke the record for the highest first-day and first-week sales for a solo artist in the history of Korea's Hanteo Chart.

We are extremely excited for both releases and have our fingers crossed for lots of cute interaction between the two throughout their album promotions!
