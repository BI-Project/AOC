In fact, according to Allkpop V had topped the '100 Most Attractive Asian Guys' since 2018 and snatched the top spot for 'The Best Handsome Face In 2017', 'The Best Handsome Man in the World in 2018' by famous STAR 101 and 'Handsome men 2018' by a global entertainment site. He even won the championship in the '100 Asians Heartthrobs' which is selected annually by Starmometer for three consecutive years.

I think we can see why V has been titled the most handsome man in the world now.

The Army's can testify that the South Korean singer and dancer is not only handsome but diligent, kind, caring, and gentle towards his members and fans. V stans are also crazy for his husky voice, fair complexion, sharp features, and his dreamy eyes.

It would be no surprise if he won the same title next year as well!
