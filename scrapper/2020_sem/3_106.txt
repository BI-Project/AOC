The father of Kpop star Taeyeon has passed away on March 9.

Taeyeon is also the leader of girl group Girls' Generation (SNSD), which is on indefinite hiatus.

According to Soompi, Taeyeon's agency, SM Entertainment, confirmed the piece of news, and said that Taeyeon is currently preparing her father's funeral with her family.

The 31-year-old's birthday is also today (March 9).

While the singer was supposed to release a song called "Happy" to celebrate the occasion, the track's release has been postponed.

Here's a translation of the statement from SM Entertainment via Soompi:

"Hello. This is SM Entertainment. Taeyeon’s father has unfortunately passed away on March 9. May he rest in peace. Please send Taeyeon warm words of consolation. We inform you that the release of Taeyeon’s new single “Happy” and its music video that was scheduled for today will be postponed. We ask fans who were waiting for the new release for their understanding, and we will provide an announcement later regarding the plans for the song’s release."

Struggling with the loss of loved ones

The Kpop star has had a tough time in recent years, as she saw the loss of two close friends in the showbiz.

They are her juniors under the same label — Jonghyun from Shinee, and Sulli, who was previously from f(x).

Taeyeon has been fighting depression as well.

In June last year, Taeyeon also opened up to fans on her struggles with depression via her Instagram Stories.

She thanked fans for their support and promised to work hard to get better.

Taeyeon was originally scheduled to come to Singapore for a concert in February 2020, but the concert was postponed indefinitely due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
