Blackpink is officially in our area!

In a media event on Tuesday, Globe president and CEO Ernest Cu introduced the K-pop group as its newest brand ambassador.

“Please welcome our newest brand ambassadors and members of the Globe family —Blackpink,” Cu said.

“This musical group of young talented artists have been topping the charts all over the world. Today, I am proud to announce that this group is chosen to endorse Globe in the Philippines,” he added.

Last week, Globe released a teaser poster hinting at a possible collaboration with the record-breaking South Korean girl band.

Globe followed its rival PLDT-Smart in tapping Korean starts as brand endorsers.

Smart Communications has earlier introduced Korean stars Hyun Bin, Son Hye-jin, and Park Seo-jun as their brand ambassadors.

Blackpink recently debuted their first ever documentary on Netflix.

Since their debut in 2016, Blackpink has become the highest-charting female K-pop group of all time. —Ted Cordero/JCB, GMA News
