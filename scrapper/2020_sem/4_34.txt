The world has become enamored with K-pop. You may not understand the lyrics, but the flower petals sprinkled atop a star’s radiant cheekbones and their grapefruit-pink hair create a special fantasy. With this project, we wanted to celebrate and explore the beauty of K-pop. Although this was in the works long before COVID-19 — and subsequent anti-Asian racism — started to spread, sharing this now feels more necessary than ever. Both music and beauty are universal, and both can help us feel connected, inspired, and soothed during this unprecedented time. Through this series, we hope you better understand (and appreciate) the stunning intricacies of one of our favorite South Korean exports.
