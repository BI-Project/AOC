K-pop stars will play a free benefit concert on April 11 to help victims of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 



Included in the lineup of the "Live K Concert" are girl bands MAMAMOO and APRIL, duo B.O.Y and soloist Kim Jae-hwan, according to performance agency SPRING ENT, Friday. 



The organizer is Korea's No.2 mobile carrier KT. It decided to hold the event for people who have been virtually unable to enjoy cultural life following the virus outbreak. 



The gig will be live-streamed on KT's IPTV (internet protocol television) service Olleh tv and Seezn, the OTT (over the top) service, at 6 p.m. (KST). There will be no audience at the concert ― which will take place at the YES24 Live Hall in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul ― because of social distancing.



"Although the concert has no audience on the spot, we will attempt to bring realism to the viewers with the help of sound, settings and other factors," KT was quoted as saying. 



Viewer donations will be given to humanitarian non-governmental organization (NGO) GoodNeighbors to help people battle the virus. As of Friday, Korea had 10,062 confirmed cases and 174 deaths.
