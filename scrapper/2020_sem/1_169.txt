JANUARY 30, 2020 — Firecrackers and lion dancers will kick things off at the annual Asian Festival on the grounds of the UTSA Institute of Texan Cultures on Saturday, Feb. 1.

Growing well beyond its original form as a Chinese New Year celebration, the Asian Festival has evolved into a commemoration of the diverse Asian diaspora, welcoming cultures from the Ural Mountains to the islands of the Pacific.

From the traditional to the contemporary, two stages will host a range of dancers and entertainers—from the famed San Antonio Lion Dance Association to KPM, a Korean pop music, or K-pop, dance team. The institute’s Back 40 outdoor area includes a space for martial arts demonstrations from various schools: Okinawan Karate, Korean Kung Jun Mu Sul, Filipino Garimot Arnis, Japanese Sumo, and more.

The Asian Festival prides itself on spectacular food and has gathered a variety of flavors for this year’s menu. From one side of the continent to the other, guests can try Turkish doner, Pakistani samosas, Indian biryani, Indonesian satay, Korean bulgogi, Japanese ramen, Filipino lumpia, Hawaiian musubi and dozens of other options.

Inside the institute, guests can find the auditorium transformed into a gallery of bonsai trees, demonstrating the care and patience that goes into the Japanese art form. Another room hosts the anime convention organizers from San Japan, with popular anime showings, computer gaming and other activities. A mahjong table will host a steady stream of guests interested in learning the popular Chinese game.

The Asian Festival remains one of San Antonio’s favorite family-friendly events, with hands-on activities and opportunities to learn through experience.

The Asian Festival is 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Feb. 1, at the UTSA Institute of Texan Cultures.
