Want to learn Korean the fun way? Then tune in Friday, to “Let’s Talk Oppa!,” an Inquirer podcast that teaches Korean phrases using dialogue from K-dramas and K-pop lyrics.

The show, powered by pioneering podcast network PumaPodcast, will help listeners better understand the K-programs they watch and the music they listen to, while giving them a deeper look at Korean culture.

Inquirer Super K editor Ruth Navarra-Mayo hosts the podcast, where she interviews experts about the Korean language and lifestyle.

“I want to emphasize the differences and similarities between Korea and the Philippines. This is what sets the show apart from other Korean language lessons you will find anywhere else. This show is tailored for Filipino Hallyu fans,” said Mayo, who pioneered the Philippine Daily Inquirer’s Korean entertainment subsection, Super K, two years ago.

The podcast will explain terms used in K-dramas like “Crash Landing on You” and “The King: Eternal Monarch,” as well as lyrics from popular K-pop artists like BTS.

“Let’s Talk Oppa!” will be available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Anchor and other podcast apps starting July 24. A new episode will be out every two weeks.
