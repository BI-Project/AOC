South Korean girl group GFRIEND is set to perform at the 9.9 Super Shopping Day event held by e-commerce platform Shopee on Sept. 9 at 7 p.m.

The performance will air on local television channels, such as SCTV, Indosiar, RCTI and MNCTV, and will be streamed on Shopee Live and Shopee Indonesia’s YouTube channel.

In addition to the performance, GFRIEND, which consists of Eunha, Yerin, Sowon, Umji, Yuju and SinB, will participate in several games during the show. The event will also feature Nella Kharisma, Syahrini and Ayu Ting Ting, among others.

Promotions will be on offer during the event, including free delivery, a midnight sale with discounts up to 90 percent, flash sales and 50 percent cash back.

“By featuring GFRIEND, hopefully we can provide entertainment for all Shopee users and K-pop fans in Indonesia,” Shopee Indonesia public relations lead Aditya Maulana said in a statement. “Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope we can give an interesting and fun shopping experience for our users in Indonesia through a series of initiatives in this campaign.”

In 2019, Shopee invited GFRIEND to perform in Indonesia at its 11.11 Big Sale event. The group was also in the lineup of online Korean culture festival KCON:TACT 2020 Summer in June, which was livestreamed on Shopee Live.

Shopee was launched in 2015 in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan. It is available on the App Store and the Play Store. (wir/wng)
