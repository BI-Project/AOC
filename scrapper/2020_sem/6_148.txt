The basic answer is that their videos are more complex. They have more setups and budget, sure, but in these videos, Josh Olufemii goes through the details to show what they do with regards to color, contrast, lighting, depth, and composition.

I don't shoot music videos, but the way they create the sense of depth in a frame, and doing this by using lights was a great refresher. Building contrast by using two "opposing" colors is something I will try in my next projects. Match cuts, the transition where the one piece of footage matches the previous one so the viewer sees a change without the jarring effect of a regular cut. It can be used in any video project. It doesn't have to be done with people in the shot. It can be of shapes, lines, or colors. Going out to find these types of shots is a fun process, and can even open you up to looking at things in a different way.

Here is another video by Olufemii where he discusses how KPOP is changing music videos and I do think he's on to something. I am not considering using digital retouching of skin and faces to artificially enhance the people in the video, as I think the real person is what I consider as being beautiful and more than significant enough. Thinking in this way is due to my culture influencing me. I've always thought of video as being the real thing, a true representation. This hasn't been true for a long time now, and it's me resisting change. These two videos might change that for me.

Will you be influenced by KPOP, or are you satisfied with what you and your cultural references have given you as toolkit?
