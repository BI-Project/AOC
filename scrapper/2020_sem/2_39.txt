• Starbucks recently partnered with K-pop group BTS in South Korea, debuting new menu items and merchandise.
• The all-purple menu includes items such as Purple Berry Cheesecake and Blooming Purple Vin Chaud.
• A visit to Starbucks in Seoul reveals that the partnership between BTS and the coffee giant is a success — and one the chain should think about replicating in the US.

SEOUL, South Korea — BTS is one of the biggest music industry icons worldwide.

The K-pop group earned $57 million in pre-tax income in 2019. It is responsible for a whopping $3.6 billion boost to South Korea's economy, and it is expected to bring in $37 billion over the next decade, according to the Hyundai Research Institute. The Washington Post reports you can buy BTS-branded Puma track suits, BTS face masks, and even a BTS-themed deck of UNO.

Now, there is finally a BTS menu at Starbucks.

On a recent trip to Starbucks in Seoul, South Korea, the all-purple BTS-branded menu was front and center at the coffee giant. So, I decided to see if Starbucks could match the BTS hype.
