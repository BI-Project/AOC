The solid power of BTS and their supportive ARMYs is really impressive!

Continuously making waves domestically and all over the world, South Korean boy group BTS is surely marking their name as one of – if not – the most successful male idol group of all time.

In the latest brand reputation rankings released by the Korean Business Research Institute, the phenomenal septet is able to top the list in May 2020. Notably, the group continues to impress as they scored the No.1 spot for two straight years now.

The rankings are grounded on various factors including consumer media, communication, and community indices. Particularly, the institute has extracted a huge amount of data from April 9 to May 9.

Dominating the list for 24 consecutive months is unsurprisingly none other than the worldwide idol group BTS. Out of the total 42,574,497 data analyzed by the institute, the group was able to score 8,802,820 this May.

Some of the high-ranking phrases from the group’s keyword analysis included “documentary”, “photobook”, and Suga’s recent collaboration with “IU.” The words such as “cancel”, “communicate”, and “speech” are also present as their highest-ranking related terms.
