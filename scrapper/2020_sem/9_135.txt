GUWAHATI: Nagaland girl Vidisenuo Belho was adjudged the first runner-up in the solo singing competition at K-Pop Indian Contest 2020.



 This event is organised by the Korean Cultural Centre India in partnership with 'The Embassy of Republic of Korea', Korean Tourism Organisation, and Samsung.



 The competition required artistes to sing a song of their choice in a video throughout the contest. 20-year-old Belho performed Heize’s ‘Can you see my Heart’ thrice to win the award which fetched her a free visit to South Korea along with a certificate and gift.



 Contestants from 18 different states competed in singing and dance challenge. Chanchui Khyai who hails from Manipur but resides in Guwahati was declared the winner of the solo singing competition.



 This year, the winners were supposed to represent the country in Changwon K-Pop World Festival in Korea but it got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.



 The winners and runners up in both the categories from India will, however, get a chance to visit South Korea, when the Covid-19 situation improves.
