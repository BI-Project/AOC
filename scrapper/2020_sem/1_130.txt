HBO Max Adapting K-Pop YA Novel 'I’ll Be the One' With Nahnatchka Khan to Produce

Khan is also eyeing the project to direct.

The upcoming YA novel I'll Be the One is being developed as a feature by HBO Max, with Nahnatchka Khan set to produce with an eye to direct.

The soon-to-be-launched streamer won a five-studio bidding war for the rights.

Author Lyla Lee’s wrote the novel that follows 16-year-old Skye Shin — a bisexual Korean-American girl — as she pursues her dreams as a participant on the reality TV singing and dancing competition K-Pop Shining Star. With the help of her new friends and her crush, world-famous model Henry Cho, Skye faces the industry’s old-fashioned beauty standards head on, setting her sights on becoming a K-pop star — one the world has never seen before.

Emmy-nominated writer Colleen McGuinness (Ramy, 30 Rock) will adapt the novel, which is set to be published this summer by Katherine Tegen Books (HarperCollins) in North America.

The project hails from Anonymous Content, where Kevin Cotter and Aevitas Creative's Allison Warren brought the project under Aevitas’ first-look deal there.

Anonymous partner Joy Gorman Wettels is set to produce, along with Kahn and her Fierce Baby Productions head of film Chloe Yellin. Aevitas's Todd Shuster and Penny Moore will also produce and executive produce, respectively.

I'll Be the One join a feature film slate at HBO Max that includes an adaptation of UNpregnant, starring Five Feet Apart star Haley Lu Richardson and Euphoria breakout Barbie Ferreira.
