DSP Media and JTBC Studios will be launching a new audition program!

On May 20, DSP Media revealed that their artists APRIL, KARD, and Heo Young Ji will be starring as special MCs for “Burn Up: Challenge to Billboard” (literal title), a new reality show starring those who dream of becoming the next big K-pop stars. The program will be released near the end of June through JTBC Studios’ YouTube channel.

As an agency that has produced many global idols including KARA, APRIL, KARD, and more, DSP Media will be partnering with JTBC Studios to produce the upcoming program. JTBC Studios is well-known for producing and distributing popular YouTube content such as “Wassup Man” and “Workman.”

Currently, the program is taking online applications, and anyone who wants to show their talents can apply. Out of the initial applicant pool, the production team will reveal the profiles of 30 applicants who pass the preliminary round through votes from the production team. Every week, the contestants will grow and develop with the support from viewers who watch videos of the survival audition program. Finally, the two finalists will attempt to chart on Billboard with a song produced by Justin Bieber’s producer HARV.

Those interested in the competition can learn more about the application process through the program’s website here!
