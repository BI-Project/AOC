Beomgyu, Huening Kai and Taehyun of Tomorrow X Together went live together for the first time.“At least it’s the first time we’re doing this in our uniforms,” said Taehyun.All three attend Hanlim Arts School and were wearing their school uniforms. Beomgyu asked about taking yearbook photos and Taehyun said that he posed with the band’s hand symbols, but that photo had not been used.“I was preparing for a group shot when someone suggested that we strike poses like idols,” said Beomgyu, “and suddenly I felt so self-conscious and didn’t know what to do.”Meanwhile, they played the quick-paced card game Halli Galli, mischievously announcing they had taken over the game segment from Yeonjun. With a bet to treat the winner to dessert, they solemnly swore that they would play fair. But Huening Kai shrieked and burst into laughter when Beomgyu and Taehyun took his arm and found a card hidden inside the sleeve.Watch the full clip at https://www.vlive.tv/video/202010.Jinyoung of GOT7 greeted fans from home, though saying he did not look “good enough.”He had been staying home doing this and that and fans protested that he was not giving them a glimpse of himself, he said with an apologetic chuckle.“I’ve turned into a homebody,” said the idol, agreeing with viewers who greeted him with “long time no see” and wishing them health.“It’s been too long a while and I’m at a loss what to say,” he confided after addressing fans around the world.He asked what they would like him to do for his solo online fan meeting that is to be held in two weeks.He listened to 20 songs with viewers, also singing along. The playlist ranged from the Beatles’ “Hey Jude” to summer favorites such as “Chicks Baeksuk” from “Infinite Challenge” and of course, songs by his bandmates.Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/202020.Changbin of Stray Kids delivered another tutorial for making music, this time with a promising student.“I’ve picked out a pupil so that it will be easier for you to follow this online,” said the musician.“Professor” Han was the guest for the last episode, but while he already was excellent, this one has quite a potential, he added, asking Seungmin to join him in front of the camera. He said the scars on their faces were from a fight, as he posted on Instagram, but they made up for the sake of this lesson.The pair actually appeared on a TV music chart program premiering “Easy,” the follow-up to “God’s Menu.” The title is ironic, though, said Changbin, as the choreography was far from easy.“It is demanding to look relaxed and casual while dancing,” they agreed.They then began the lesson of the day: how to do the fan-featuring rap for “Easy.”Watch the full clip at https://www.vlive.tv/video/202092.K-pop Herald reporters Hong Dam-young and Kwon Yae-rim picked the 30 best songs from Seventeen.The boy band reached a career high, selling 1 million copies of its seventh EP “Heng:garae” and the group has amassed a huge following with its upbeat and energetic songs, as well some soft and sweet ballads, said Kwon. The fact that many of the songs are written by the bandmates themselves also speaks to their talent, the reporters added.Seventeen started out as a boy-next-door group, said Hong, recalling seeing them at the time of their debut, five years ago, admitting she did not expect them to grow this fast.The top 30 list started with last year’s soothing ballad “Hug.” “Adore U,” hailed as one of the best debut singles from a K-pop band, came in at No. 13. And the top three were: latest lead track “Left & Right,” one of their biggest hits “Very Nice” and lead track from the sixth EP “You Make My Dawn.”Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/201694.Naver’s real-time broadcasting app V allows fans to interact with their favorite K-pop stars through live broadcasts.
