If it’s K-Pop that has been getting you through these days of quarantine, here is a way to add some entertainment to your daily at-home routine. K-Pop legends, BTS, have launched a web series titled Learn Korean that’s meant to help people understand the lyrics of their music better. We checked it out and although it’s a cool new way to get closer to the ‘BTS Army’, don’t expect to be fluent in Korean by the end of it.

You can stream the web series on the Weverse app and access all the episodes for free. As of 24th March, there are three episodes out, each about three minutes long. Over the course of the next few weeks, there will be a total of 30 episodes released focussing on Korean grammar and expressions.

The lesson plans have been developed by researchers at the Korean Language Content Institute and Professor Heo Yong of the Department of Korean Education at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. The point of releasing the web series is to help fans across the world understand the lyrics of their songs better (which are written in Korean). The episodes feature each of the BTS members saying common Korean phrases. Unfortunately, although the concept seems wonderful, it’s a little hard to keep up if you have absolutely no prior knowledge of Korean.

BTS has cancelled all their concerts this month due to concerns regarding the coronavirus but if you’re missing your favourite K-pop stars, it’s a fun way to mingle with the ‘army’ on the app. Just don’t expect to learn much Korean from it.
