A one-week event featuring conferences, exhibitions, and a concert revolving around the K-wave will be happening this November.

From 16 to 23 November, the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism is bringing together an all-rounded event to celebrate the Korean wave, also known as the Hallyu wave, with the Korea Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy. This will be presented as ON: Hallyu Wave, an all-in-one festival for fans, content creators, companies, and more. It will also host real-time sales sessions.

The first few days of ON: Hallyu Festival will be targeted at content creators and companies, while a K-pop concert catering to fans will be held on its final day. The programme will be available for live streaming globally through Naver’s platform, V Live.

Dubbed the Unite ON: Live Concert, the lineup includes artists spread across multiple genres, such as SuperM, MONSTA X, Oh My Girl, Somi, ITZY, IDIOTAPE, Jambinai, Leenalchi, Ambiguous Dance Company, Loco, Changmo, and Colde.

The show will be joined by special guests from the region, namely Raisa from Indonesia, K-ICM from Vietnam, ft APJ, and Trinity, from Thailand. It will be hosted by MCs Somi and Bo Min.

According to news sources, the ON: Hallyu Festival aims to “provide comfort to people around the world who are exhausted from COVID-19 while providing helpful opportunities to local businesses through the power of Hallyu”, said Culture Minister, Park Yang-woo.

Many other concerts and events have also shifted online in view of the coronavirus. Most recently, BTS announced an online exhibition following their virtual show MAP OF THE SOUL O:NE, while other artists such as SEVENTEEN, TWICE, NCT, and IZ*ONE have been announced to perform at the Mnet Asian Music Awards.
