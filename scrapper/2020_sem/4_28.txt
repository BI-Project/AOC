Popular K-pop girl group Girls' Alert have been forced to split after coronavirus took its toll on their management company's coffers.

The five-member band, who had hits with their debut single Dreamgirls in 2017 and We Got The Power in 2019, will disband after their managers were unable to continue paying their contracts.

In a statement, management company Roots Entertainment told gutted fans: "First, we would like to apologise.

"Due to the repercussions of COVID-19 and various other circumstances, our company's situation has worsened, and it is no longer possible for us to continue leading Girls' Alert.

"Therefore, Roots Entertainment has terminated the contracts of all of the members.

"We made this decision out of consideration for the members, so that each of them can freely pursue her own individual activities in the future, and we also want to cheer them on in the hopes that they will make fresh starts elsewhere.

"We hope that you will support and cheer on each of the members in the future.

"As for the activities that the group was already carrying out before this announcement, we will do our best to pull them off with the members that are available, so we hope that there will be no confusion."

The group - made up of members Jisung, Seul Bi, Saet Byeol, Goo Seul and Narin - were ranking in the fiercely competitive top 50 best K-pop girl bands in February.

Meanwhile, rival girl group Red Velvet's star singer Wendy has revealed she's recovering well after sustaining serious injuries at a K-pop concert on Christmas Day.

The singer fell from a platform more than two metres off the ground and sustained a severe fracture to her pelvis, as well as injuring her wrist and cheekbone.

She spent the next two months in hospital but was discharged in February to recover as an outpatient.
