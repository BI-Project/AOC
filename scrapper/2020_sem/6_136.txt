• There appears to be a growing effort to mass report President Trump's social media accounts on June 27.
• The idea seems to have been popularized by a video posted by TikTok user @caprhicorn, who on June 21 called on TikTok users to mass report Trump's social media accounts.
• The push comes following an effort from TikTok teens and K-pop stans to flood Trump's latest rally with false ticket request, seemingly resulting in his campaign over-estimating attendance.

TikTok teens and K-pop stans were largely credited with trolling President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa by reserving tickets en masse with no intention to attend. It seems that the next collective stunt may be mass reporting the President's social media accounts on June 27.

A TikTok from user @caprhicorn seems to have publicized the idea and organized a specific time for the mass reporting to take place. Published on June 21, the video, which currently has over 450,000 likes and approximately 1.2. million views on TikTok, calls on fellow TikTokers to mass report Trump's social media accounts at 4:00 pm on June 27.

"Itll send a message that were fed up on his public, verified vent account, and itll sting him that he got duped by Gen Z again," the text of the TikTok reads.

The TikTok quickly spread on the app itself, with people coyly dueting it — "I duetted this by accident while making a sandwich," the caption on one duet video reads — asking others to promote it. A video from @grubbygrouper, who has over 34,000 followers on TikTok, replying to a comment echoing the sentiment also went somewhat viral, racking up approximately 700,200 views and 168,000 likes.

@caprhicorn — a.k.a 19-year-old Rhiannon ODonnell — told Insider that she got the idea for the mass report after seeing Trump's tweets about COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement.

"It sounded like the ramblings of an old man who doesn't really know what he's talking about," she said.

Chatter about the potential event has also spread over to Twitter, including to certain K-pop fans who appear to be trying to spread the word to the rest of their fandoms, while others have called explicitly for people to spread the information to K-pop stans. ODonnell said that she had seen a significant number of comments on her video asking for K-pop fans to get involved.

A follow-up TikTok to ODonnell's original video outlined the strategy, telling people to report Trump's Twitter account for "abusive and hateful content as well as not being interested in the account" and his Instagram account for "hate speech and violent organizations."

Mass reporting isn't a new tactic. In 2018, Into reported on people targeted trans users by mass reporting tweets that used the acronym "TERF," which stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Mass reporting can lead to users being suspended or subject to account restrictions. BuzzFeed News' Katie Notopoulos recounted in 2017 how trolls locked her Twitter account for 10 days by mass reporting one of her old tweets. The tactic is deployed in fandom spaces as well.

It's unclear what consequences there will be if people do mass report the President's accounts on Twitter and Instagram this Saturday. Twitter recently flagged one of his tweets for "glorifying violence" and labeled a video he posted as "manipulated media" before removing it, citing copyright concerns. As ODonnnell's original TikTok video promoting the effort said, the reporting seems to be more about sending a message and trolling the President himself rather than attempting to extract any other form of justice. ODonnell told Insider that the goal isn't necessarily to ban the account.

"The people are fed up with [Trump] already with what he's been doing to minority groups and how he's affecting everyday life, and the people will do anything to get that message across," ODonnell said.

TikTok teens and K-pop stans have been in the limelight recently for actions trolling Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, spamming people using racist hashtags, and flooding police apps. It's worth noting that recent actions to mass-reserve tickets to Trump's Tulsa rally began with Mary Jo Laupp, a "TikTok Grandma" who posted a video on June 12 telling people how to reserve free tickets, though TikTok teens and K-pop stans were largely the ones lauded for the trend.

"Gen Z's online presence is massive, and the fact that we're using the platforms we have to spread awareness about issues is genuinely amazing," ODonnell said, also saying that she plans to continue using her platform (she now has over 11,000 followers on TikTok) to speak about injustice and inequality. "I'm incredibly proud of my generation, and I am so proud of us for uniting to fight for equal rights for all people!"
• Trump officials are anonymously admitting that TikTokers and K-pop fans likely helped tank his Tulsa rally, despite vigorously denying it in public
• K-pop stans have been heralded as digital heroes for fighting racists online, but Black fans are still getting left out of the conversation
• Trump says a million people have requested tickets to his Tulsa rally, but it could just be because TikTok users are trolling him
