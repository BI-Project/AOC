The Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) are back for its 22nd edition to reunite music fans around the world.

Throughout the years, MAMA has been held in Macau, Vietnam, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the awards ceremony will take over the virtual space, ‘NEW-TOPIA,' for the very first time.

Happening on 6 December, the red carpet starts at 4 PM (TH/ID Standard Time) or 5 PM (SG/PH/MY Standard Time), and the ceremony will begin two hours later at 6 PM (TH/ID Standard Time) or 7 PM (SG/PH/MY Standard Time).

Hosted by renowned actor, Song Joong Ki, the annual prestigious awards show celebrates the best Asian artists and music in the region. Songs and albums released between October 24, 2019, to October 28, 2020 are eligible for this year's awards.

Fans can vote for their favourite acts via the official MAMA website until 5 December, 23:59 KST.

Last year, BTS swept the awards show by clinching 'Artist of the Year', 'Album of the Year', 'Song of the Year' and 'Worldwide Icon of the Year'. This time, some of the artists leading the nominations include BTS, TWICE, BLACKPINK, EXO, MAMAMOO, and Red Velvet with five nominations each.

BTS have also been announced as the first performers for this year's edition, where the group is expected to perform 'Life Goes On,' the title track from their November comeback album, BE. More performers will be unveiled soon.
