Strict rules that K-Pop singers have to follow

According to Vox, K-Pop is a "global phenomenon that brings billions of dollars to South Korea each year. Launching its so-called "idols" into superstardom, K-pop allows performers who rise to the top of the highly competitive industry to earn the kind of fame and fortune that most people couldn't imagine. But that level of success comes at a price — a price that many would consider too high.

Those who choose the K-Pop life do what it takes to please the people who buy their albums, concert tickets, and every item of merch that's available. Eunice Chang, a production manager who is involved with K-pop events, appearances, and concerts, told CBC News, "[Idols] will do everything, anything for their fans because that's the only reason for them to exist." Chang also noted that K-Pop stars aren't likely to cause a fuss even when there's trouble. "[W]hen you are popular, you can not show your weak side," she explained. "People will say: 'Oh, you have everything. Why are you saying that?' They get a little judgmental."

Jeff Benjamin, a K-Pop music columnist, told the CBC that even the term "idol" adds to an extreme level of expectation, saying, "Just that word in itself gives the idea that they have to be perfect — they have to be the ideal standard of entertainer. That's a lot of pressure for a young person." That pressure seems even more extreme when you find out about the strict rules that K-Pop stars have to follow.
