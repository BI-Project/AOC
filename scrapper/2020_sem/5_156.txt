K-pop fans can catch the concerts through the TikTok Stage in-app channel, and can expect to see the likes of Monsta X, iKon, Kang Daniel, AKMU, Apink and more for the TikTok Stage Live From Seoul event.

As for TikTokStage With HIPHOPPLAYA, it will feature a roster including the likes of Jay Park, Zico, Epik High, Crush and Dean, and more.

Fans will also get to interact with the performers live, and be asked to participate in fundraising via fun TikTok in-app challenges.

According to a statement from TikTok, for every live viewer who tunes in, TikTok will donate US$0.50 (S$0.70), and all funds raised will go towards supporting charity efforts for those most affected by COVID-19.

Doreen Tan, User and Content Operations Manager, TikTok Singapore, said: “We're grateful for all the artists and entertainers who use TikTok to connect with their fans, and can’t wait until we can see them live on stage again. Till then, we’re committed to connecting our community and fans with these massively talented acts from home – all while doing our part to aid COVID-19 relief efforts.”
