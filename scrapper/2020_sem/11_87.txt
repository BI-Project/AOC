In anticipation of his first-ever solo album, EXO and SuperM member Kai just released a teaser for his new music video, "음 (Mmmh)". Fans around the world were shocked when they saw the beloved K-pop star tried out a new look for the occasion: long, neon-green hair.

During his nine years in the industry, Kai has experimented with color, dyeing his hair teal, crimson, pink, and platinum. But the 26-year-old has kept his style in pretty much the same undercut, only briefly verging away to test out the mullet trend. It was kind of a shock then to see Kai's fluorescent-chartreuse hair falling past his shoulders. The look, with matching glow-in-the-dark tattoos, is truly stunning and a wonderful representation of the fanciful, thrilling, beauty explorations of K-pop stars.

In the 36-second teaser, which has already been viewed over 1.3 million times on YouTube, Kai switches between the two sides of himself we've gotten to know over the years since his debut with EXO in 2011 and SuperM in 2019. First, we see the electric performer we're familiar with exhibited in all his shirtless, incandescent glory. Then he shifts into the fashion icon we often see sitting front row at Gucci runway shows posing in a sophisticated charcoal suit with his signature sleek, ashy-brown undercut.

Both hairstyles were the work of Park Naejoo, a renowned hairstylist based in Seoul, who works with NCT, Monsta X, and GOT7. (He even took the reins on JB's hair for our digital cover shoot.) We can't wait to see more of Park's creations for Kai in action when "음 (Mmmh)" officially drops on November 30.
