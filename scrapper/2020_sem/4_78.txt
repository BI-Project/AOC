While in Seoul recently, I couldn't stop staring at people's nails. Everyone I met seemed more fun looks than the next. One of my friends had a floral and checkered nail art. Another had long navy acrylics with silver embellishments.

"Nail trends in Korea tend to be simpler and cuter in style rather than flashy and spectacular," says Sunny, the owner of Sunkuku Nail Art Studio, in Seoul's Hapjeong neighborhood. People often pick colors to match the season and decorate their nails with crystals, she adds. Although shorter nails are generally preferred, Sunny notes her clients seek out her private studio for nail extensions.

Sumi Lee, who owns SSum Art Studio in Seoul's Gangnam area, is also known for her talon-like creations. K-pop stars like KARD's Jiwoo and Jamie Park often stop by her studio to take their nail shapes beyond the usual choices: round or square.

One of my favorite stops of the trip had to be Unistella, though. Here, I met up with Park Eunkyung, who is at the helm of not only Korea's nail trends but the world's. Instagram has helped put her masterpieces on a global stage. She graced my nails with some of the top-requested looks, like watercolor and chunky glitter.

All three Seoul-based nail artists shared the top nail trends in Korea. Turns out, most are inspired by familiar things: an emoji, a shoe, a song, a beauty product, and a natural phenomenon. May these exciting nail art ideas from across the world inspire your next manicure â€” at home or otherwise.
