• Grimes recently said on Instagram that Gowon, a member of South Korean girl group Loona, is her child X Æ A-Xii's godmother.
• While it's unclear if Grimes was being serious, the two singers previously collaborated on the track "love4eva" in 2018.
• Loona fans were quick to pick up on the comment, quickly making memes about Gowon's new godmother status.

This weekend, Grimes gave another piece of crucial information about her and Elon Musk's child, who is now named X Æ A-Xii. In an Instagram comment, the "Miss Anthropocene" singer said that Gowon, a member of South Korean girl group Loona, is the child's godmother.

User @yaellsk asked Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, in the comments of the singer's latest post if Gowon was the godmother of her baby, to which Grimes succinctly replied with, "yes." Two days after the exchange, Grimes' reply has over 6,700 likes.

While it's unclear if Grimes is serious about naming Gowon, whose real name is Park Chae-won, as X Æ A-Xii's godmother (Grimes has a history of trolling fans), it wouldn't be completely out of the blue. Grimes and Gowon previously collaborated together in 2018 on Loona/yyxy track "love4eva." Gowon is a member of South Korean girl group Loona, a 12 member group broken up into several sub-units including Loona/yyxy, of which Gowon is a member. While Grimes does not appear in the "love4eva" music video, she lends her voice to the song's intro.

Loona fans, known as Orbits, were quick to pick up on the Instagram comment and began to make memes congratulating Gowon on her godmother status.

Others pointed out how the godmother news felt similar to online hoaxes that originated in the Loona fandom. In Feb. 2019, a tweet spread (with over 185,000 likes) claiming that Loona members Yves and Chuu were "lesbian Korean billionaires" who had married and had a combined net worth of $170 billion. (That was a repeat of a similar 2017 viral tweet about "lesbian Chinese billionaires," which involved two Chinese members from Korean girl group Cosmic Girls). That's not to mention a semi-viral tweet from Feb. 2020 that claimed that Loona member Olivia Hye had recently become the richest esports athlete in the world.

It's worth noting that Loona and its fandom occupy a significant place in internet culture, particularly given the fact that the group and its music found its footing on gay Twitter through sultry pop hits like "Eclipse" and the ever-popular "stan Loona" meme. The group's music has soundtracked TikTok trends; its fans have broken iTunes chart records by streaming music. Orbits regularly allude to Gowon being friends with Nicki Minaj, taking over the rap industry, and feuding with Eminem. Given the meme culture surrounding her in particular, being Grimes' child's godmother doesn't feel like too much of a stretch.

Insider has reached out to Grimes and Blockberry Creative, Loona's label, for comment.
