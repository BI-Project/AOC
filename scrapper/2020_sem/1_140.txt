All of the women agree that Chaeryeong is the comic relief of the group. “She’s hilarious,” says Ryujin, smiling brightly at her friend. “Chaeryeong is also nice, polite, and always wants to take care of people, including me. So I'm very thankful for her.” Yuna, the youngest of the group and the quietest throughout the interview, carries a cheeky defiance in her that seems to always bubble just underneath the surface. “Even though Yuna is the baby of the group,” says Chaeryeong, “there are times when she becomes the leader, she sets the mood, and she makes people feel better. So she has that kind of empowering side to her.”
