The K-pop boyband had been slated to make their comeback performance at the famed festival, which has now been pushed to October. It's unclear whether they can make the new dates of Oct 9 – 11 and Oct 16 – 18.

K-pop boyband BIGBANG was expected to make their comeback in April at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, but it looks like fans will be left disappointed as the event has now been postponed to October. 



The festival in the Southern California desert has been pushed back because of concerns over the coronavirus spread, organiser Goldenvoice said on Tuesday (Mar 10).

They released this statement: "While this decision comes at a time of universal uncertainty, we take the safety and health of our guests, staff and community very seriously. We urge everyone to follow the guidelines and protocols put forth by public health officials."

The festival had been slated to take place over two weekends (Apr 10 – 12 and Apr 17 – 19) and BIGBANG was to have performed on Apr 10 and Apr 17.

The group announced the performance in January and the show was to have been their first public performance since its members began enlisting in military service in 2017, and since Seungri left because of a scandal. It's unclear whether they can make the new dates of Oct 9 – 11 and Oct 16 – 18.

BIGBANG members G-Dragon, Taeyang, TOP and Daesung recently renewed their contract with YG Entertainment, reported Soompi. The announcement, made by the label on Wednesday, will mark the group’s third renewal with the company since their debut in 2006.

Coachella is one of the biggest music festivals in the world, bringing some 500,000 fans to an open-air site in Indio, east of Los Angeles, over two weekends. The line-up this year includes headliners Frank Ocean, Travis Scott and Rage Against The Machine.
