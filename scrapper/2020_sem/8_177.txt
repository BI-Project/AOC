Amid pandemic, the Korean Cultural Center (KCC) Philippines’ popular event Pinoy K-pop Star will go online.

Instead of the annual contest that brings together the most talented vocal and performance cover artists around the country, Pinoy K-pop Star will be showcasing the past winners this year through the “PKS Rewind 2020: The Online Reunion” on Aug. 21 at 3 p.m. on KCC Philippines’ YouTube channel.

This is KCC’s first online concert under its Korea at Home campaign aimed at bringing Korean culture closer to Filipinos while they stay at home.

“PKS Rewind 2020” will feature performances by 2014 PKS vocal champion Jean Kiley, 2015 vocal champion Hergie King, 2018 vocal second runner-up John Paul Manuel, 2018 vocal champion Venisse Siy, 2018 and 2019 performance champion Mix In, and 2019 vocal champion April Rose Tolentino.

Fans will also be able to watch the performance of guests Dasuri Choi and popular Pinoy boy band SB19, some members of which were past PKS contestants.

The online concert will feature interviews and raffle of goodies for the avid supporters of Korean culture and KCC.

“PKS Rewind 2020” is the first activity of KCC under Korea at Home this month. Joining past Korea at Home themes such as K-Food, K-Music, K-Film, and K-Arts are the new categories: K-Contests, K-pop and K-Language.

In addition, KCC followers will get the chance to win prizes through this month’s Photo & Essay Contest and the weekly K-Quizbee.

KCC will have events including more live shows, competitions, thematic screenings and educational offerings under Korea at Home.
