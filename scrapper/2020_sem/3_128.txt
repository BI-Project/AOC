Dua Lipa is stepping back into the world of K-pop with another girl group collaboration.

The star will team up MAMAMOO singer Hwa Sa for a new version of one of her latest releases.

The ladies will be bringing a remix of her song Physical which drops on 17 March.

The track will see Dua Lipa and Hwa Sa sing in English while new lyrics in Korean have also been included.

Physical comes from the singer’s Future Nostalgia album which dropped in January.

The New Rules singer has previously teamed up with K-pop girl group BLACKPINK on the song Kiss and Make Up.

Given Hwa Sa’s electric features on songs like Ddang with Suran and Don’t with Loco, fans already know Physical is going to be a banger.

The official announcement came after fans had speculated about the duet in online forums when Hwa Sa was credited as a featured artist on Physical on streaming platforms.

The pop stars crossed paths at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards where Hwa Sa covered New Rules before Dua Lipa took to the stage for Don’t Start Now. She was also given a MAMA trophy for international favourite artist.

Meanwhile the K-pop star has previously sung solo tracks Twit, I Do Me and In The Fall.

MAMAMOO, which debuted in 2014 under RBW Entertainment, is made up of Hwa Sa, Solar, Moonbyul and Wheein.

Some of their best known tracks include HIP, Gogobebe, Wind Flower and Taller Than You.
