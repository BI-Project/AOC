After six weeks of dominance by Red Velvet’s “Psycho,” a new song has finally taken over the top spot! IZ*ONE’s “FIESTA” scored high on every chart source and entered the chart at No. 1. Congratulations to IZ*ONE!

Although their comeback was delayed by several months due to controversy involving the “Produce 101” series, IZ*ONE was able to make a successful comeback with their first studio album “BLOOM*IZ” following a long hiatus. The title song “FIESTA” is a future house style dance song with bass and synth sounds. The festive song represents IZ*ONE being in full bloom and turning their dreams into reality

After its long reign at No. 1, “Psycho” continues to prove its longevity as it still remains strong at No. 2 this week.

Rounding out the top three is IU’s “I Give You My Heart”, the 11th and final single from the OST of the tvN drama “Crash Landing On You,” which placed three songs in the top 10 this week. “I Give You My Heart” is a song that expresses the heartfelt wishes Ri Jung Hyuk (Hyun Bin) and Yoon Se Ri (Son Ye Jin).

The final new song in the top 10 this week is BTS’s “ON.” Despite being released near the end of the week, the title track from BTS’s fourth studio album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” made a strong entry at No. 6. The powerful hip hop song reflects on BTS’s experiences since their debut seven years ago and accepts the challenges that come along as a result.
