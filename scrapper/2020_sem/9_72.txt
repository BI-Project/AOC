As K-pop continues to make waves in the global entertainment scene, Indonesia is home to many of the genre's biggest fans, at least according to Twitter.

Teaming up with fandom data observatory K-Pop Radar, Twitter's latest findings about K-pop conversation in 20 countries suggested that Indonesia was among the top three countries with the largest volume of K-pop tweets between July 1, 2019 and June 30, right behind Thailand and South Korea in first and second spot, respectively.

Indonesia was also placed fourth of the top-20 markets by unique voices on Twitter, which saw the United States, Japan and South Korea secure positions one to three.

K-pop sensation BTS is said to be the most-talked-about South Korean artists in Indonesia, followed by SM Entertainment’s boyband EXO and JYP Entertainment’s boyband GOT7, girl band BLACKPINK and boy band NCT 127.

However, the most-mentioned K-pop song in Indonesia was not by BTS, but instead EXO’s 2019 single “Obsession”. The rest of the top-five list is dominated by BTS, namely “ON”, “BoyWithLuv”, “BlackSwan” and “Shadow”.

Stray Kids was named the most-mentioned rising K-pop group in Indonesia, followed by eight-member boyband Ateez, TXT, IZ*ONE and SuperM.

Despite the pandemic, which has canceled or postponed many K-pop concerts, tours and fan meetings, Twitter’s head of K-pop global partnerships Kim Yeon Jeong said in a statement that conversations on the platform regarding the genre showed no sign of decrease. “K-pop supporters continue to connect with one another and share excitement on Twitter, such as rooting for their favorite artist launching a new song, or donating to support a certain issue in a country."
