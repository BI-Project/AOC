India’s first all-girls Korean Pop (K-pop) band 5High is going to release their first official music video on 9XO channel at 3 pm on Sunday.

The band’s first music video will be an adaptation of the K-pop song Piri that has been sung by a popular South Korean girl band Dream Catcher.

The 5High K-pop band comprises of five girls- Nasa Rianchi, Maria Mize, Dhevi Hangu Pombu, Nana Secii and Hitali Vernekar.

The band was formed after a rigorous selection process by three popular K-pop stars Alobo Naga, Kuvelu Tetseo and Alune Tetseo.

The hunt for India’s first-ever All Girls K-Pop band was announced by consumer giant Marico’s haircare brand Livon.

Opened to all K-Pop enthusiasts in India, the talent hunt was aimed at finding and honing the best K-Pop talent from across the country.

As a part of the competition, hundreds of entries participated in the auditions in Guwahati and Shillong that was held in November last year.

After the group 5High was formed, the selected girls of the group travelled to Mumbai where they were rigorously groomed by the judges for the shoot of the music video.

The country’s first all-girls K-pop band will now be officially making their debut with the release of their first music video.
