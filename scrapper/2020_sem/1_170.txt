One of the girls was familiar with the group, however, the other one was not. Though Tao was humble to this little confusion, he later asked the cameramen and producers to cut the part as he was embarrassed about them not knowing about EXO. He later exclaimed that EXO was popular when BTS were still in their struggle phase. Some of the fans of BTS took this sportingly, while some threw shade on Taoâ€™s reaction about BTS.
