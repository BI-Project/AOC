Four Korean musical acts—BTS, SuperM, Monsta X and NCT 127—have all reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the U.S. with at least one project, with two doing so for the first time just this year.

Now the race is on to see which soloist or group from South Korea can become the fifth, making history the minute they place an album or EP somewhere between Nos. 1 and 10 on the chart.

But who will it be? There are a number of artists who have been working hard at becoming the next breakout stars in the States, and it may be any one of the names mentioned below.

It would appear that Exo could be the next K-pop group to reach the highest tier on the Billboard 200, as they are the act that has come the closest to the region without ever breaking in, though it’s tough to say if they will actually end up becoming the latest lucky name to make history. The band saw their album Don't Mess Up My Tempo peak at No. 23 in 2018, an impressive placement for the time. That seemed to suggest they were headed for major things, but their newer release, 2019’s Obsession, somehow only rose as high as No. 182.

Exo probably has another collection coming this year, and many will be watching closely to see where it lands.

Korean quartet Blackpink have also come relatively close to the Billboard 200’s top 10 in the past, and chances are whenever they share a new collection it will perform even better. Their 2019 EP Kill This Love managed to peak at No. 24, coming in one rung below Exo’s highest placement.

Since then, Blackpink has gained plenty of fans, and if they release an album as opposed to an EP (their last effort only featured five songs), they may gain ground thanks to an increase in streams.

A Member Of BTS On Their Own

In addition to their work with BTS, who have now landed four chart-toppers and another top 10 title, two members of the septet have not only reached the Billboard 200 on their own, but broken into the top 40 with solo releases. Both RM and J-Hope have scored successful albums, as their projects under their monikers, Mono and Hope World, peaked at Nos. 26 and 38, respectively.

Whenever either performer releases another full-length on their own, they may step up even higher, possibly even reaching the top 10. It’s also possible that another member of the group could present a solo endeavor next, though RM and J-Hope appear to be the most likely candidates for this honor.

There don’t appear to be many other well-known K-pop acts who look ready to enter the Billboard 200’s loftiest arena with their next release, but that doesn’t mean someone who has never placed on the tally before won’t become the fifth Korean name to do so.

SuperM shocked many in the U.S. music industry last year when they started their first EP together, a self-titled effort, at No. 1 on the chart, becoming just the second Korean musical act to rule the roost. It’s unlikely, but possible that another big surprise is in the works.
