E-commerce platform Shopee Indonesia has announced South Korean group Stray Kids as its latest brand ambassador.

Established in 2017, Stray Kids consists of members Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, HAN, Felix, Seungmin and I.N.

Shopee Indonesia will kick off a series of collaborative projects with the octet with performances at a televised event called Shopee 11.11 Big Sale with Stray Kids on Nov. 11 at 7 p.m. The show will be livestreamed on Shopee Live and Shopee Indonesia’s YouTube channel. It will also air on local television stations, namely RCTI, MNCTV, SCTV, Indosiar and ANTV.

The show includes a “Chit-Chat” session where Stray Kids members will answer questions from STAY (fans of Stray Kids) via Shopee Indonesia’s social media platforms, as well as interactive games and promotions. The show will also feature Indonesian singers and influencers, including Betrand Peto, Tiara Andini, Nella Kharisma, Atta Halilintar and Aurel Hermansyah.

Stray Kids leader Bang Chan said the group was excited and proud to be a part of Shopee Indonesia. “We believe that we wouldn’t be here today without our fans’ support. We promise to give special collaborations and performances for STAY in Indonesia,” Bang Chan said in a statement.

Handhika Jahja, director of Shopee Indonesia, said the decision to choose the members of Stray Kids as the platform's ambassadors was based on customers’ strong interest in K-pop. “We’ve noticed that Stray Kids fits our values and character: young, creative and passionate. Through this collaboration, we’ll hopefully be able to reach fans of Stray Kids and K-pop,” Handhika said.

Launched in 2015, Shopee is a popular e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It has named renowned celebrities and athletes as brand ambassadors, including the late Didi Kempot and Cristiano Ronaldo. (wir/wng)
