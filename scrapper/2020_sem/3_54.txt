A survival competition show for K-pop boy bands is slated to premiere in April on Mnet, the cable channel said Wednesday. 



"'Road to Kingdom' will invite talented boy groups to have a cutthroat but fair match," Mnet said. "The viewers will see how these singers grow up day by day through the competition."



The lineup has not been confirmed, but seven or eight bands will appear. Pentagon, Golden Child, ONF, ONEUS, TOO and The Boyz are reportedly among them. AB6IX and SF9 considered joining but decided not to.



"Road to Kingdom" is a prequel to the channel's coming program "Kingdom." The winners from the former show ― who will be selected through voting ― will acquire a priority to be featured in "Kingdom." Further details about "Kingdom" are under wraps. 



In 2019, Mnet aired "Queendom," a competition show for female K-pop artists that included MAMAMOO, Lovelyz, AOA, (G)I-DLE, OH MY GIRL and soloist Park Bom. 



Two hosts of "Queendom," actress Lee Da-hee and TV personality Jang Sung-kyu, will preside over "Road to Kingdom."
