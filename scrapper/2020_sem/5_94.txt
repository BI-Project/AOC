K-Pop Ramen Shop, a brand new destination for Korean-style ramen and dumplings, will make its debut in the Oak Lawn area this week.

The restaurant is set for a soft opening at 5150 Lemmon Avenue on Friday, May 29 according to a post to the K-Pop Ramen Shop Facebook page. It’s the brainchild of cousins Tuoc Nguyen and Alexis Huynh, and will bring a bounty of Korean-influenced comfort food dishes to the neighborhood.

As its name would indicate, brothy noodle bowls ares a fixture of the menu at K-Pop, ranging from classic tonkotsu and shoyu ramen broths to a spicy seafood option with fish cake, squid, shrimp, and fried shallot. Jajangmyeon, or black bean noodles, are also on the menu, alongside spicy bibimbap with chicken, pork, or beef, and a Korean burger topped with kimchi and a fried egg.

K-Pop will also be open late for those end-of-night noodle cravings — til 10 p.m. on weekends and midnight on Friday and Saturday. They’re offering 15 percent off this Friday and Saturday as part of the grand opening.
