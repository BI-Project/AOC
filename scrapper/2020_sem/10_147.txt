On Wednesday, League of Legends K-pop group K/DA debuted its second music video — “More,” featuring featuring Madison Beer, Soyeon and Miyeon of (G)I-dle, Lexie Liu, Jaira Burns, and Seraphine.

K/DA debuted in 2018 with its first single, “Pop/Stars.” The music video, which debuted during the League of Legends World Championship Finals in 2018, is essentially an advertisement for League of Legends’ line of pop star skins.

But the song, music video, and, well, pop stars hit so much harder than that. The music video quickly went viral, gaining popularity outside of the League of Legends community, too. Now, it’s got more than 384 million views on YouTube. To say a second music video has been anticipated would be an understatement.

And now it’s here, and it’s hype. Like “Pop/Stars” before it, “More” is flashy, exciting, and inspirational.

All of the original K/DA members returned for the song “More,” — meaning the in-game characters, Akali, Ahri, Evelynn, and Kai’Sa. But the musicians who previously voiced these characters — Beer, Soyeon and Miyeon, and Burns — have all returned too, with some additions: Lexie Liu and Seraphine. (Seraphine is League of Legends’ newest playable character, who also has a skin in the K/DA universe.)

But this year, K/DA fans are getting much more than “More.” League of Legends developer Riot Games first released a second single, “The Baddest,” in September — with two new singers, Bea Miller and Wolftyla. A full album will be released, too, featuring some hugely popular musicians—like Twice, a K-pop girl group that’s topped many, many charts. Other newcomers include Kim Petras, Bekuh Boom, Annika Wells, Aluna, and League of Legends character Seraphine.

K/DA’s full album, called All Out, is expected to be out on Nov. 6. New in-game skins are coming to the game soon, too. Presumably, K/DA will perform at the League of Legends World Championship as well.
