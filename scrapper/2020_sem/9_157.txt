But when he was approached by Korean talent management company, JYP, to audition for a group they were putting together. It is not something you would expect a future Olympian to consider but on a whim, Jackson decided “why not?” turning down a scholarship to Stanford in the process.

“I told myself, ‘Why not just give it a try? I have nothing to lose,’” he is quoted as saying in previous interviews.

Taking that approach has worked out well for him. Jackson has always had a clear goal – “to make history.” While he chose not to do it in the sporting arena, he may well be on his way to achieving it in numerous other areas. He is now a solo artist, TV star and designer with a fashionable reputation that has a legion of loyal followers. At last count, he had 18.4 million followers on Instagram; 23.2 million fans on Weibo; 10.3 million followers on Tik Tok; 1.4 million followers on Twitter and 2.09 million subscribers on You Tube. Jackson has also delved into entrepreneurship, setting up his own label “TEAMWANG” in 2017. In fact, he attributes this as being his biggest achievement to date.

“I always had this idea in mind,” he says, referring to the start of his career. “I kept looking for opportunities when things didn’t work out. After debuting, I seized every chance I had on camera, only because there weren’t a lot of chances for me. Chance never waits,” he says, adding he is someone who is always prepared for a fight.
