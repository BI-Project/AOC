Kim Jung-yeon, a former member of K-pop group A6P, is making his debut as a trot singer in March. 



The singer's agency VL Entertainment said Kim will release a trot single on Mar. 14. Trot is a genre of Korean old pop music, known for its repetitive rhythm and vocal inflections. 



Kim debuted as a member of A6P in 2015, but it wasn't until recently that he rose to stardom as a contestant in TV Chosun's audition show "Mr. Trot." 



The singer competed up to the quarterfinals but failed to make the next round. The semifinals episode is set to air Thursday.



The show, which has been airing since January, has stirred a trot craze, with its viewership rating continuing to rise. The latest episode rated over 30 percent.
