Over the past decade, K-Pop has grown to become one of the largest global conversations on Twitter today. Despite the global COVID outbreak, there were 6.1 billion K-Pop related Tweets in the past 12 months worldwide. Now with over 300 K-Pop Topics (by artist names) that can be followed on Twitter, fans around the world can engage via Tweets about their favorite artists.

To celebrate 10 years of #KPopTwitter success, Twitter has partnered with K-Pop Radar to release K-Pop data across 20 markets to show how the passionate global K-Pop community shares their love and connects with their favorite artists around the world.

“All we can say is thank you — it’s been a pleasure to watch and participate in the growth of K-Pop over the past 10 years,” said YeonJeong Kim, Head of Global K-Pop Partnerships at Twitter. “When K-Pop artists want to reach a global audience, they go on Twitter to connect with their passionate fans who want to be the first to see and talk about what’s happening. These fans — many who are young and based all over the world — are flocking to Twitter to join these fun #KPopTwitter conversations to feel connected to a global fan community.”

Twitter has organized an exclusive “Decade of #KPopTwitter” global live party in Twitter’s Blueroom, bringing together several of the K-Pop pioneers (#SUNMI @miyaohyeah, Wonder Girls), global top stars (#KIHYUN and #HYUNGWON, MONSTA X), and fast-rising artists (#BangChan, Stray Kids) in a fun talk-show format to discuss the past 10 years of K-Pop and Twitter. K-Pop fans can submit questions using the #AskKpopTwitter hashtag and join the livestream at @TwitterLive or @TwitterKorea starting at 11 am SGT on September 22, 2020.

“Twitter continues to be the best way for music fans to see and talk about what’s happening,” the platform said in a release. “That’s especially true in the K-Pop world, from legends like PSY, Super Junior, Big Bang, 2NE1, and Girls Generation; to today’s superstars such as BTS, EXO, GOT7, and BLACKPINK; to the next-generation talent including Stray Kids, ATEEZ, TXT, and IZONE. K-Pop fans use Twitter to get the latest updates from the artists they love; connect with other stans anytime and anywhere in real-time; and express their appreciation for the music, dancing, and ‘Hallyu (Korean Wave)’ culture that has taken the world by storm.”

We can’t wait to see what the next 10 years of K-Pop and Twitter bring to the world.”
