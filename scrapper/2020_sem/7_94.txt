South Korean boyband BTS is scheduled to perform at a week-long event held by e-commerce platform Tokopedia called Waktu Indonesia Belanja (WIB), or Indonesia Shopping Time, on July 29 at 8 p.m.

The performance will be aired on local television channels SCTV and Indosiar and streamed on Tokopedia Play.

In addition to BTS, the event will also feature performances from NOAH, Weird Genius featuring Sara Fajira, Raisa, Syakir Daulay, Wali and Project Pop, among other talents.

WIB is taking place from July 25 to 31, offering promotions and discounts with the aim of helping consumers buy staple needs without having to go outside.

“The initiative is also in line with the #JagaEkonomiIndonesia [#MaintainIndonesiasEconomy] campaign as one of our ways to support the country’s economic recovery, which has been impacted by the pandemic, using technology,” Tokopedia corporate communications vice president Nuraini Razak said in a statement.

Debuted in 2013, BTS is managed by South Korean entertainment company Big Hit Entertainment. The group, which consists of V, Jungkook, Jimin, Suga, RM, J-Hope and Jin, has been a brand ambassador for Tokopedia since October 2019.

BTS is a worldwide music phenomenon. Its members delivered a speech at the United Nations in September 2018 and were named Next Generation Leaders by Time magazine in October 2018. The group released its latest album, Map of the Soul: 7, in February and broke the record for South Korea's most preordered album of all time, with more than 4 million copies sold. (wir/wng)
