New K-Pop band H&D sent fans wild as they made their debut, and we’re already obsessed.

Lee Han-gyul and Nam Do-hyon have united to bless us all with H&D, making their official debut on 21 April.

The duo – who are signed up with PocketDol Studio – have also released mini album Soulmate, as well as singles Soul and Good Night.

Moments after their debut, they began trending worldwide on Twitter, as impressed followers rushed to praise them.

‘Hangyul and Dohyon, you’ve worked hard best boys. you deserve nothing but all the best things in the world & let’s walk only on flowery path,’ a fan posted.

‘We will always be on your side just like how you are always on our side, I am so proud of you! congratulations on your debut as “H&D,”’ one said.

While a Twitter user said: ‘Congrats and goodluck for the album. I wish H&D success and lets walk in flowers with your fans. So H&D deserves to be happy and amazing (sic).’

And another celebrated: ‘H&D will always be special for one its. You both deserves to be successful and loved. Fighting H&D!’

Vocalist Han-gyul and rapper Do-hyon were previously part of X1 – the 11-member group who were formed on Produce X 101 in July, 2019.

They released their debut single Flash in August, with their debut EP Emergency: Quantum Leap reaching number one in the Korean charts.

However, they were marred by allegations that the line-up was pre-decided before public votes were counted.

Following the drama, X1 disbanded at the beginning of the year – with Han-gyul and Do-hyon now blessing us with H&D.
