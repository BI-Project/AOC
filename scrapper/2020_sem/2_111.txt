SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- K-pop superstars BTS canceled an upcoming concert series in South Korea's capital as the country that exports entertainment worldwide tries to contain a soaring virus outbreak.

It follows a near-shutdown of entertainment in hard-hit parts of China, the world's second-biggest economy and second-biggest box-office market.

BTS, which performed at the Grammys and at New York's Grand Central Terminal for "The Tonight Show" in recent weeks is seen as an emblem of South Korea's cultural and economic power.

Its management company said the current outbreak in South Korea made it impossible to predict what the situation would be on the expected concert dates in April.
