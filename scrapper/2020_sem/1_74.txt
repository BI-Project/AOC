(UPDATED) South Korean boy group X1 has disbanded after the group figured in vote-rigging allegations, the members' respective talent agencies announced Monday.

In a joint statement, translated and published by Korean entertainment news website Soompi, the 9 entertainment companies managing the 11 members decided to disband the group after they failed to reach an agreement with CJ ENM, which managed X1.

"The X1 members and each of the agencies negotiated under the condition of unanimous agreement, but we could not come to an agreement, so we have decided on their disbandment," the companies said in the statement.

Following the announcement, the hashtag #WeTrustX1 topped the list of trending topics on Twitter, both in the Philippines and worldwide.

X1 debuted in August 2019 and was composed of the winners of the reality show "Produce X 101," the fourth season of South Korea's hit "Produce 101" franchise.

The group ceased promotions around November after police investigation revealed that the show's producers manipulated the results of the audience votes.

The producers also allegedly accepted bribes from entertainment company representatives to favor certain trainees in the competition.

IZ*ONE, the girl group from the third season, also halted promotional activities due to the controversy.

The show's producers, Ahn Joon Young and Kim Yong Bum, were arrested in November over the vote-rigging allegations. Ahn later revealed that the results of all 4 "Produce 101" seasons were manipulated.

CJ ENM, which also manages IZ*ONE, reportedly said the girl group was "positively considering" resuming its promotional activities.
