BTS are officially the first all–South Korean group ever to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, as Billboard reports. The K-pop band’s “Dynamite” debuted atop the chart with 33.9 million U.S. streams and 300,000 sold in its first week, according to Billboard via Nielsen Music/MRC Data. In addition, Billboard reports that it’s the biggest digital sales week since September 2017 when Taylor Swift sold 353,000 units for “Look What You Made Me Do.”

BTS released “Dynamite” on August 21, along with a colorful music video. The visual broke YouTube’s 24-hour streaming record with 101.1 million views in the first day.
