A day after they were partially credited with President Trump’s low rally turnout in Tulsa, Oklahoma, K-pop fans flooded the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag on Twitter Monday morning, turning it into the platform’s number one trend—and fooling the algorithm into categorizing it as a K-pop trend—as the massive, dedicated fanbase continues to support the anti-racism movement.

Over 25,000 tweets were posted by early Monday morning with the hashtag, according to Twitter’s trending topics, which also identified #WhiteLivesMatter as a K-pop trend. K-pop fans (sometimes referred to as “stans,” a slang term for a dedicated supporter) posted videos, memes and animated gifs of their favorite Korean pop bands and artists, and many included anti-racism messages with their tweets. Some users riffed on the idea of white lives by saying the Pillsbury Doughboy, stormtroopers from Star Wars and endangered white tigers were on the receiving end of disrespect, among other jokes. The hashtag takeover came on the heels of Trump’s smaller-than-expected turnout for his campaign rally in Tulsa Saturday night, which reports partially attributed to fake ticket reservations made by K-pop fans, along with users of the TikTok social media app. The Washington Post reported that the K-pop fans and TikTokers likely contributed to the Trump campaign overestimating their expected crowd size, but probably not the sole cause of the low turnout. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment by Forbes.

Over 6 billion. That’s how many tweets K-pop fans posted in 2019, according to Twitter’s blog.

This isn’t the first time K-pop fans have deliberately drowned out racist hashtags on Twitter. Fans took over #WhiteLivesMatter on June 3, as the hashtag was gaining ground on the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag being used amid protests and civil unrest sparked by George Floyd’s killing. K-pop fans have waged similar efforts against #BlueLivesMatter and #WhiteOutWednesday in recent weeks.

The Trump campaign in a Sunday statement said K-pop fans and TikTokers used “bogus” phone numbers to register for the rally, which “never factor” into their expected attendance numbers. Other critics, like MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, said the small turnout could be attributed to fears of the Covid-19 pandemic and Trump’s declining popularity (which recent polls appear to support).
