DUBAI: Emirati singer Ahlam Al-Shamsi, dubbed “The Queen,” announced on Twitter that she will be collaborating with K-pop band BTS.

A fan commented on one of her tweets writing: “Please answer me Ahlam, will there be a collaboration with BTS?”

“Yes, of course there is,’’ the star, who celebrated her 51st birthday last night, said.

After the star’s response, fans expressed their enthusiasm about the potential partnership with the hashtag “#AhlamxBTS.”

However, Al-Shamsi’s confirmation was not enough for supporters of the artists. They were curious about the topic of the song and its language.

“What will an Arab-Korean song have to say,” one user commented.

Others questioned the credibility of it all. “Ahlam, are you really collaborating (with them) or is this a joke?” a fan wrote.

Al-Shamsi, the coach of the “The Voice: Ahla Sawt,” is considered one of the most influential musicians in the Middle East, with over 27 million followers on social media and several chart toping hits.

BTS is the most streamed K-pop band in Saudi Arabia on Spotify. Last year, they had six tracks in the top 10 K-pop list in the UAE and four of the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.

The music genre’s upbeat tempo, painstakingly choreographed dance routines, and colorful visuals have turned it into a global phenomenon, despite the language barrier.

BTS recently launched a mobile simulation application, “BTS World,” which allows players to become the group’s manager (in the virtual world — and without real-life cash).
