Social media has always been a powerful tool, but in the current and ongoing protests currently happening in the United States, it cannot be overstated how valuable it is for many reasons. From being able to spread information and resources to allowing protesters to connect online, Twitter and Instagram especially have become vital in allowing protesters to keep informed, connected and most importantly, safe.

It was exactly this that was the priority mission of a bunch of K-pop stans recently, who managed to crash a Dallas Police Department app. The app was developed in order for people to send in information regarding alleged crimes such as rioting and looting, and has been described by many as a “snitching” app as it encourages the community to turn in people. Dallas PD took to Twitter to announce the development of the app, but their plan was quickly thwarted thanks to K-pop stans who began to flood the app with FanCam videos (live footage videos of K-pop band members).

“If you have video of illegal activity from the protests and are trying to share it with @DallasPD, you can download it to our iWatch Dallas app. You can remain anonymous,” the Twitter account for Dallas PD wrote in a tweet, linking to the app. What followed was Twitter user @ngelwy retweeting the link and directing their followers to send in as many FanCams as possible, which consequently temporarily crashed the app.

This has happened multiple times since, with K-pop fans also finding Police issued hashtags to flood these feeds with gifs, videos and images.

Never underestimate the power of K-pop fans!
