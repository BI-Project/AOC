MAX is getting fans hyped about a collaboration on his upcoming album Colour Vision!

The 27-year-old musician teased that there would be a song on the album that features an artist who speaks Korean.

“SO I JUST GOT VOCALS IN FOR A FEATURE ON THE ALBUM…AND THEYRE IN KOREAN…😏,” MAX wrote.

While MAX didn’t specify who would be on the song, many fans are guessing Suga from BTS, who he met at a concert earlier this year and was later spotted with at a basketball game.

MAX has already released on song off of his new album titled “Where Am I At.”

Colour Vision is set to drop on May 22nd.
