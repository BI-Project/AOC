Singers Jung Joon Young and Choi Jong Hoon have had their prison sentences reduced after they were jailed on gang rape charges in 2019.

Last year Jung, 31, and Choi, also 31, were convicted of charges of aggravated rape, including sexually assaulting women in 2016.

In court in Seoul on Tuesday, reports Yonhap News, singer Jung’s sentence was reduced from six to five years.

Meanwhile Choi, formerly of the boy group F.T. Island, will now serve two and a half years rather than his original sentence of five.

Both men had been sentenced to undergo 80 hours in a sexual violence rehabilitation programme and have been banned from working at children and youth facilities for five years.

2 Days & 1 Night star Jung had admitted to the charges of secretly filming and distributing sex videos, but denied the charge of rape, while Choi had denied all criminal charges against him.

Jung and Choi burst into tears after being convicted.

Choi was the leader of FT Island, a rock group which debuted in 2007. Their hits include I Hope and Lovesick.

Jung was the front man of the band Drug Restaurant and had a successful solo career with songs including The Sense Of An Ending and Sympathy – however, he retired from the entertainment industry after admitting to filming and sharing intimate footage.

Choi also quit the industry last year in the wake of the allegations against him.
