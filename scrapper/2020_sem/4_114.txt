Oh My Girl are releasing new music later this month as a full group.

Member Jiho is returning from her hiatus to join Hyojung, Mimi, YooA, Seunghee, Arin and Binnie.

While details of their comeback are currently being kept under wrap, we do know to keep an eye out on 27 April for something new.

In a short and sweet statement to media, their agency WM Entertainment said: ‘Member Jiho’s condition has improved as she focused on recovery during her hiatus.

‘After continuous discussion with her, the final decision was made for her return.’

WM Entertainment revealed in January this year that Jiho will be taking a temporary break for health reasons, and had been receiving treatment in hospital since last year ‘due to frequent deterioration of her health and symptoms of anxiety.’

They added: ‘Recently, the symptoms of anxiety have worsened, and we decided that it would be difficult for her to carry out her activities as part of Oh My Girl as usual. To prioritise our artist’s health, we decided that she should take a temporary break.’

The comeback will be the group’s first in around eight months after the release of BUNGEE last August.

Oh My Girl also competed on the reality TV competition Queendom with the likes of MAMAMOO, AOA, Park Bom and (G)I-DLE.

Some of the best known hits include Liar Liar, Remember Me and Listen To My Word.
