BTS caused quite the bang over the weekend after their 24-hour "Bang Bang Con" online event featuring old concert footage and fan meetings garnered more than 50 million views. So which K-pop group should step up to the virtual mic next?

SuperM already has a livestream concert in the books with their "With You" performance during the World Health Organization and Global Citizen's star-studded One World: Together at Home concert that Lady Gaga curated this past Saturday, but their fanbase would love more.

After Blackpink reminisced on their historic Coachella 2019 debut by posting two epic throwback clips earlier this month, Lisa turned heads with her latest dance cover of QUIÑ and 6LACK’s "Mushroom Chocolate" on her personal YouTube channel Monday. Blinks would love to see the Thailand-raised K-pop singer pull off more sensual stunts with the rest of the girls in a full-on livestream show.
