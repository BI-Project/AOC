If you have NCT's complex dance moves at your fingertips or can sing every single Shinee song since 'Hello' by heart, now is the time for you to make the world your stage.

SM Entertainment, home to some legendary K-pop groups such as Girls' Generation, EXO, Super Junior, Red Velvet, and TVXQ, has launched online applications for its global auditions. They are on the search for all-rounded talents that will potentially become the new faces of the K-pop industry.

Aspiring stars are to submit an email application, specifically titled as name/ age/ gender/ category, ex. (Jenny/ 18/ Female/ singer), together with a dance video, a singing audio clip, as well as front and side face shots without retouching. K-pop stars in the making born in 2000 - 2010 (between 10 - 20 years) regardless of race, nationality, and gender are welcome to apply.

Here's how to get your road to K-pop stardom started:

Since 2006, the annual SM Global Audition has become a pivotal platform for uncovering K-pop stars from all over the world. Some of them are Wendy and Joy from Red Velvet, Yuta, Renjun, Johnny, and Mark from NCT as well as Amber Liu. The global auditions, which used to take place physically in selected countries, has been moved online this year due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
