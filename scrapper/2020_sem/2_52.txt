Samsung has inked a new partnership with Kpop super band BTS to promote its new smartphones. BTS is a massive global entity in its own right with countless fans across the globe. This partnership will allow Samsung to reach out to a younger demographic which makes up a significant chunk of the BTS fan base.

As part of this collaboration, Samsung will first support the band’s global contemporary art initiative called CONNECT BTS, before expanding the partnership to other initiatives. It wouldn’t be surprising if BTS members start appearing in commercials for Samsung products.

Samsung teams up with BTS to promote its smartphones

Samsung has a history of leveraging the massive reach that Kpop bands have for marketing purposes. It most recently worked with another super band Blackpink for the launch of the Galaxy A80. Not only was the girl group retained to promote the device, Samsung even launched a Galaxy A80 Blackpink Edition in select markets.

Samsung has not detailed exactly what shape its marketing efforts with BTS will take but industry insiders expect the boy band to participate in Samsung’s promotion and marketing events for the Galaxy Z Flip and the Galaxy S20 lineup. BTS member V was also spotted at Samsung’s Unpacked event for these devices in San Francisco.

BTS is perhaps the biggest and most globally recognized Kpop bands in history. Aligning its products with this band will enable Samsung to get its message out to a younger demographic across the globe.

“We hope we can deliver a good experience to fans of BTS and Galaxy devices around the globe through collaboration with BTS,” said a Samsung official, adding that “We are planning various activities other than ‘CONNECT BTS.'”
