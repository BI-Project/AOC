It's a bird! It's a plane! It's SuperM.

The K-pop supergroup stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night (Feb. 11) to leave late-night viewers spellbound.

The project, which brings together members of established acts SHINee, EXO, NCT 127 and WayV, cut loose with a performance of “Jopping,” a single lifted from their chart-topping debut The 1st Mini Album. The LP went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last year, meaning SuperM are the first Korean group not named BTS to achieve the feat.
