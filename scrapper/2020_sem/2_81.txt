A whole lot of things went down at Oscars 2020, but one of the biggest surprises of the night came from five-member Korean group A.C.E. after the ceremony was long over.

To celebrate Parasite’s historic win, A.C.E performed at one of the film’s after-parties and surprised attendees with their very own rendition of the some of Korea’s most beloved songs, which, of course, included some BTS.

During the celebration, A.C.E took the stage at Los Angeles’s Soho House with covers of BTS’s hit songs “Fake Love” and “DNA.” The quintet honored Bangtan with explosive choreography and live vocals, which the guests seemed to love. Apart from their BTS covers, the group also took on H.O.T.'s 1998 track "Hope" as well as their own original songs.

After seeing A.C.E’s performances, both the originals and covers, many fans took to Twitter to show their support for the group. “So a.c.e performed at the after party of the first foreign language film to win best picture, a movie which one of their company’s editors worked on, did their own songs, covered a bts song, and yuchan and byeongkwan wore crop tops. like it really does not get better than this,” a fan commented. “A.C.E COVERING BTS'S "FAKE LOVE" AT THE OSCAR'S AFTERPARTY HELLOOOOOO YES THIS IS AMAZING,” another added.

A.C.E — made up of members Donghun, Wow, Jun, Kim Byeongkwan, and Chan — debuted in 2017 with the track “Cactus.” The group’s name is an acronym for “Adventure Calling Emotions.”

Since their debut, A.C.E has put out three EPs: A.C.E Adventures in Wonderland, Under Cover, and Under Cover: The Mad Squad, which came out this past October. Even before their official debut, the quintet became known for their covers of other artists — including BTS, BLACKPINK, and John Legend — and last night only continued their trajectory of success.
