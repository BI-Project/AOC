Following the great success of K-pop co-ed trio SSAK3, another mixed-gender band is gearing up to write its own success story.



CHECKMATE ― comprising two females (Sieun, Suri) and three males (Yongseok, Nason, Noah) ― is set to drop its first album "DRUM" on Sept. 21, its agency GRACE COMPANY Entertainment said Tuesday.



"Acclaimed producers in and out of Korea have worked on the debut track," the company said in a statement. "The members have already caught the attention of fans in Europe and South America (through social media)."



The agency added that Yongseok would "play a central role" this time, but did not elaborate. 



Co-ed pop groups like Koyote (KYT) and Cool basked in popularity in the 1990-2000s, but are hardly seen these days. Single-gender bands are more common because they are easier to manage and better for marketing, according to industry insiders.



Amid this trend, SSAK3, a one-off K-pop group formed through MBC's variety program "Hang out with Yoo," achieved a meaningful feat in July by topping music streaming charts with its retro-flavored "Summer Sea Again."
