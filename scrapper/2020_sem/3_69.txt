K-pop stars N.Flying led the charge as artists arrived for filming on the variety show Immortal Songs.

Suyeon from girl group Weki Meki, Song Ga-in and the boy group N.Flying were all spotted at the KBS Open Hall to start shooting on another episode.

The Rooftop singers were all smiles as they arrived, wearing casual jumpers and jeans.

Meanwhile Suyeon, dressed in a woolly blue and white jacket, waved to the waiting cameras when she walked past.

The South Korean musical variety show sees musicians perform reworked versions of their favourite songs.

N.Flying member Yoo Hwe Seung stood out in Saturday’s episode, which was a special instalment dedicated to child stars.

He took part in a duet with young entertainer Asia Lee Campbell on a version of Adele hit Someone Like You.

Previous Immortal Songs guests have included The Rose, Golden Child, The Boyz and Stray Kids.

In the same episode VERIVERY teamed up with child dance prodigy and YouTube star Na Ha Eun.

Together they covered the group’s song Tag Tag Tag, and BTS classic Fire.

On the show, Na Ha Eun she chose it because ‘it’s a powerful song with a fast rhythm that gets faster as it goes on, so it’s difficult. But I really enjoyed it.’
