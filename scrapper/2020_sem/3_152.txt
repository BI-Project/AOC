For the Korean boy band BTS, the success of its sprawling, genre-defying pop album “Map of the Soul: 7” is a sign of how the rising K-Pop act is cementing its place in American culture.

This past weekend, the album—which mixes rap, ballads and electro-pop—hit No. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200 chart, the band’s fourth chart-topper in roughly a year and nine months.

It’s a success story that defies conventional wisdom about the kinds of music Americans will tune into—not least because the songs are mostly sung in Korean. Across style and subject matter, BTS’s music and squeaky-clean image appeal to millennial and Generation Z listeners who are drawn to themes of self-acceptance and empowerment.

In the two years since BTS broke through stateside, becoming the first K-Pop act to top the U.S. album chart, the South Korean 20-somethings who formed the group in 2013 have sold out U.S. stadiums to legions of obsessive fans, graced “Saturday Night Live” and performed with Lil Nas X at the Grammy Awards. On their new album, they collaborate with artists like Halsey, Troye Sivan and Ed Sheeran, and their social-media presence, including 24 million Twitter followers, is now a force to be reckoned with. (Recently, the band canceled some South Korean concerts because of the coronavirus.)

Even among the many K-Pop acts with loyal fan bases, BTS stands out. Here, seven reasons why a seven-member band that’s been together seven years is finding global success.
