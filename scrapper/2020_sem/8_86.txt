With four months left in 2020, K-pop's biggest and brightest stars are still planning to deliver their debut albums and other special projects. But which one are you most excited about?

On the heels of their top 40 Hot 100 hit "How You Like That" smash, Blackpink plans on dropping the K-pop quartet's highly anticipated debut LP The Album on Oct. 2.

SuperM returns with their own debut album Super One on Sept. 25. But before then, the so-called "Avengers of K-pop," formed by members of SHINee, EXO, NCT 127 and WayV, will keep it "100" with the first single coming out next Friday, Aug. 14. Previously, SuperM's debut EP The 1st Mini Album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in October 2019.
