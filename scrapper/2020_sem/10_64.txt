Today marks the first death anniversary of K-pop actress-singer Sulli.

Last year on 14 October, Sulli, 25, was found dead in her home in Seoul. Her manager found her body on the second floor of her house in Seongnam, south of the capital, when he could not reach her on Sunday, news website Korea Herald reported.

The police confirmed Sulli’s death and said that she was grappling with severe depression, without elaborating.

Fans have been commemorating her through social media, by posting messages such as “It’s already one year. Time passes so fast” and “Let’s remember your smile and your strength.”

The hashtags #Sulli and #Remember_Sulli are currently trending on Twitter.

One of Sulli’s best friends, actress Kim Sun Ah visited the tombstone at a local burial ground where the late star rests in.

According to Koreaboo, Kim posted this message on her Instagram, “I couldn’t sleep at the thought of coming to see you. I have not lived a day without remembering. I missed you so much, and there was so much I wanted to talk about when I meet you. I wanted to tell you more fun stories, but I’m sorry all I did was cry too much.”

“But then again, you must know just how much I love you! I want to see you so much and miss you lots. And your daughter, Goblin, is doing really well. Even if I get married, I will come here with my husband holding hands, and when I give birth to kids, I’ll hold their hands and bring them here too. As long as I’m alive, I will keep coming to see you, so don’t be lonely.”

Kim had adopted Sulli’s cat, Goblin after the actress’ passing.
