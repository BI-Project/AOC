K-pop boy band WINNER will drop the pre-release single "Hold" on March 26, according to its agency YG Entertainment, Friday. 



"WINNER's rapper Mino co-composed the song with producer-cum-DJ R.Tee. He also contributed to the lyrics," YG said. "Mino participated in the creative process of four numbers included in the upcoming album as well." 



WINNER's third full-length EP "Remember" will hit shelves on April 9. It offers 12 songs of cross genres.



YG took to its official blog on Thursday to unveil a teaser image for the music video of "Hold." It is a family photo of the four members ― Mino, Seungyoon (Yoon,) Jinwoo (Jinu), Seunghoon (Hoony) ― and Suhyun of YG's brother-sister duo Akdong Musician (AKMU.) 



In the picture, WINNER members, sporting white shirts and black jeans, have a uniform hairstyle. They also have a mischievous look on their faces.



WINNER debuted in 2014 with the album "WINNER 2014 S/S." The quartet's flagship tracks include "REALLY REALLY," released in 2017. 



Jinwoo and Seunghoon, both 28, are set to begin their obligatory military service this year.
