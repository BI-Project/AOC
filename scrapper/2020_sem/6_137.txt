It doesn’t matter how old you are: fancy dress parties never get stale. Hong Kong influencer Feiping Chang celebrated her birthday with husband Lincoln Li by her side at a K-pop-themed extravaganza filled with glittery costumes, over-the-top hairdos and catchy singalongs last month.

Hosted by friends Jonathan Cheung and Calvin Wang, the city’s it-crowd turned up in full force; Victoria Tang-Owen, Arne Eggers, René Chu, Eleanor Lam, Harris Chan and Tiffany Chan all dressed to impress in their zaniest pop-idol attire.
