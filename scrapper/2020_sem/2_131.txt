Amid the coronavirus outbreak, concert-goers attending the upcoming show by South Korean boy band NCT Dream in Istora Senayan stadium in Jakarta on March 1 will be required to go through a body temperature check prior to entering the venue, according to an announcement issued by the promoter.

"All audience members must go through a body temperature check that will be conducted prior to entering the venue," read the announcement issued by concert promoter Mecima Pro on its social media accounts. "If you are measured as having a body temperature above normal [>37.5 Celsius degrees], we will ask you to go through a further health check-up at a specialized area that will be provided at the venue."

Those who already feel unfit will be required to bring along a doctor’s note that states their health condition and that they are allowed to attend the show.

If the medical team at the venue decides that the audience member is unhealthy and may pose a risk of disease infection to others, they will be prevented from attending the show.

Concert-goers are also recommended to bring along their own face masks and to wear them during the show if necessary, as well as hand sanitizer and tissues to maintain self-hygiene.

NCT Dream is a subunit of South Korean boy group NCT. The group debuted on Aug. 25, 2016 with a single titled “Chewing Gum”.

On September 2019, NCT Dream was included in Billboard’s 21 Under 21 list for the second year in a row.

The band was supposed to perform in Singapore on Feb. 15, but in late January decided to postpone the show over coronavirus fears. (gis/kes)
