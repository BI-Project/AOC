K-POP FANS will start 2020 right as two K-Pops groups will be visiting the country in January and February.

The first to come is Winner, whose members — Yoon, Jinu, Hoony, and Mino, will return to the Philippines on Jan. 25 at the Mall of Asia Arena for the Winner [Cross] Tour in Manila. The group recently released its third mini-album Cross, with track “So So” as well as solo songs from members Hoony and Yoon.

The quartet last met with their Filipino fans in November 2018 during its Everywhere tour. The Winner [Cross] Tour in Manila is presented by YG Entertainment, Live Nation Korea, and PULP Live World.

Meanwhile, K-pop group Seventeen — composed of S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, The8, Mingyu, DK, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino — will return to the Philippines for the Seventeen World Tour Ode to You in Manila on Feb. 8 at the Mall of Asia Arena. The group released its third full album, An Ode, last September, and surpassed 160,000 in album sales within 24 hours of its release, triple the first-day album sales for their previous mini-album You Made my Dawn. The new songs will be showcased in the upcoming tour, the group’s third, following Ideal Cut which commenced in 2018 and visited eight cities across Asia. Seventeen World Tour Ode to You in Manila is presented by Pledis Entertainment, Live Nation Korea, and PULP Live World.
