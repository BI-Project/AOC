Within just a matter of hours of making its debut, K-pop girl group aespa is already shattering records.

The four-member band released its first song, Black Mamba, accompanied by a music video, on Nov 17.

In just nine hours, the music video reached a staggering 10 million views, making it the fastest debut music video to reach 10 million views in K-pop history, according to allkpop.com.

Aespa, comprising Karina, Giselle, Winter and Ningning, is renowned talent agency SM Entertainment's first girl group in six years.

Karina shared in an official statement about the quartet making its debut: “I still can’t believe it’s real. I can feel the pressure, but the feelings of wanting to show the world a good song and a good performance are even stronger.”

The group made headlines shortly before its debut when it announced that there will be an artificial intelligence element to aespa.

Each of the four human members will have a virtual counterpart. Meaning, Karina, for instance, will also exist as a virtual member, or an avatar, named ae-Karina.

It will be interesting to watch how aespa's futuristic concept unfolds.
