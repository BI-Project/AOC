Korean Esports org, T1, just announced a project with kpop group, BTS, on their Twitter. Sporting the hashtag #T1xRUNBTS, the team tagged the group in a short 16-second video featuring sound waves, muffled music, voices, and a heartbeat monitor that concludes with a glitch into a T1 RUN BTS graphic.

Kpop and esports have been merging more and more over the past few years, especially in the League of Legends scene with Riot Games' K/DA group, releasing their first single POP/STARS in 2018, and releasing an entire album this year. The first couple of songs have already been released with more on the way.

This marks yet another big partnership between kpop and esports, with BLACKPINK partnering with PUBG Mobile earlier this Fall, and BTS launching their own mobile game as well, which is coming soon. Popular EXO member, Sehun, purchased part of LCK team, SeolHaeOne Prince, earlier this year, too. This isn't even the first time BTS and T1 have been mentioned together this year either, with Korea offering a new law that would allow celebrity members, like those in BTS, or legendary esports stars, like Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok, to delay their mandatory military duty.

This announcement comes with a wave of other announcements made by the team in the past months since the end of their League of Legends season, including the departure of head coach Kim, the release of their other coaches and analysts, the signing of star Twitch streamer, Tyler1, and more.
