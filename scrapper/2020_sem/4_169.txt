South Korea has quickly become an epicenter for beauty trends around the world. It comes as little surprise, given the international appeal of K-pop and Korean skin care. But as for what sits atop the heads of South Koreans? That is evolving. According to hairstylist and salon owner Chahong, "People [are starting] to pay attention more an inner beauty, a minimal lifestyle, and self-reflection than following the trend for just an appearance." In the salon, this translates to low-maintenance cuts and hair colors that seem slightly worn in.

We spoke to Korean hairstylists and Song Yein, digital editor at Allure Korea, about the cuts, colors, and treatments folks are asking for right now.

Whether they’re going blonde or blue, clients tend to ask for ashy undertones. The cool shades complement the red and yellow tones in many Koreans’ complexions, says hairstylist Kim Sunwoo. They also cancel out the redness many Koreans naturally have in their dark hair so new shades can look more vibrant. "Bambi brown" is a color Chahong says is trending — and it just so happened to originate in her salons. "We put in a gray tone for a clear brown, then a chocolate brown [that looks like] Bambi's fur."
