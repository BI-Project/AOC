Q: First Holland song you'd recommend to new fans?

H: The truth is, many people remember me for "Neverland". They remember me as the Holland who's full of youth and sings about hope. Although I might have changed a little, at my core I'm still the Holland who talks about hope and love.

So the song I want to recommend is "Neverland". Other than that it's a matter of taste, but I trust that you'll like all of them. It's OK if you don't like them. I'll just write better songs. [laughs]
