K-pop star So Young had taken out her Instagram's comment section in a bid to stop some Malaysian online users from posting mean comments about her stage name, Babi.

In Malay, babi refers to the animal pig, and it is sometimes used to make a derogatory remark.

The member of the female K-pop group Fly With Me is upset her social media has been flooded by comments likening her name to the animal.

This has forced her to put up a warning to Malaysians on her IG.

This isn't the first time that Malaysian netizens have committed this shameful behaviour.

Back in 2018, singer Dua Lipa was ridiculed online by some Malaysians when she posted 'Happy Birthday, Babi' on an Instagram caption to her father.

The singer born to Albanian parents then edited it to "Happy Birthday Dad".

Isn't it time for Malaysians to realise we don't have the ownership to the word 'Babi' which carries different meanings in other languages?
