“Nothing much changed due to coronavirus regarding Suho's release,” a rep tells Billboard, adding that the reaction to the album will impact how they approach album sales. In order to promote Self-Portrait, Suho appeared in a variety of digital content and live streams prior to his first solo album's arrival on Monday.

With much of K-pop’s content aimed at global and digital audiences rather than just consumers in Korea who buy physical albums and EPs, most Korean pop acts aren’t really changing how they’re doing things when it comes to new music releases. Many K-pop artists have taken to social media and YouTube to practice social distancing, such as TWICE launching a TikTok channel. Others are starting YouTube channels, while some artists are documenting their work on new music, including Seventeen's Hoshi.

An acute outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea in January forced the cancellation of live music events throughout much of February and March, while some televised programs, including weekly performance-oriented music competition shows, continued filming throughout the month without live audiences. Events based around audiences will continue to be impacted with delays and postponements.
