The conversation surrounding K-pop on Twitter has apparently grown exponentially especially between late 2016 and the first half of 2018. BTS won its first Top Social Artist award at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2017, and EXO also opened its official Twitter handle in July of that year with the release of "Ko Ko Bop."
