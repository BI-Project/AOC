Yeji: "Itzy and Midzy are like good friends who give each other strength when life gets tough, and the courage to continue forward! I want to tell Midzy that we’re receiving and learning positive energy from how they’re always rooting for us below the stage, and likewise, that we also want to become artists who always root for them as well."

Lia: "Midzy is like a roof. Just like how five tall pillars mean nothing when there’s no roof to hold them together and provide protection, we need Midzy for Itzy to be complete. We, as Itzy, will do our best to provide good support as pillars so that the roof doesn’t fall through. I learned a lot about love and warmth from Midzy. I want to tell them how beautiful, precious, and lovable they are!"

Ryujin: "They’re like friends, and because I’m so grateful for the amount of love Midzy gives us, I always wonder how to reciprocate that love back to them. I’m thankful that Midzy has made me into a person who thinks about how to return love, and although I say this often, I want them to know they’re all so cool and beautiful just as they are."

Chaeryeong: "I want to say Itzy and Midzy are each other’s joy! We’ve learned from Midzy how to love and root for someone, and how to express that love and support. I think we can pass on how to dance to Midzy!"

Yuna: "I think Itzy and Midzy exist to make every moment of each other’s lives special! Midzy always makes us feel comforted, and I get a great sense of security from their support. I want to thank Midzy for always being there for us, and I want them to know how much we love them!"
