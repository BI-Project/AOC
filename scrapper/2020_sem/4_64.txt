If you're into making your tresses look cute sans the damage that coloring or bleaching can bring, hair accessories are your new best friend. Clips, barrettes, headbands, and ribbons were once thought to be only for kids, but with the right styling, you can make them look grownup-appropriate. Ready to make the change? Keep on scrolling for a list of female K-pop idols that are obsessed with this hair accessories:
• Joy loves wearing headbands, often in different designs and textures. Follow her cue and use a bejeweled one to bring all the attention to your hair.
• Bobby pins are another favorite hair accessory of many female K-pop idols. They now come in tons of pretty colors, not just the black ones we are familiar with. You can stick multiple hairpins on both sides of your head like a makeshift headband a la Lia, or you can place them in crisscross positions for a fun change like Yeji's.
• Who says pigtails can only be worn by grade school students? You can still sport them until now—just look at how Hyun Ah does it! She used colorful elastics to create cute bubble pigtails!
• Want to keep your hair away from your face but you're tired of regular headbands? Choose one with a ribbon! You may opt to use one made with velvet, like Jennie's, to provide more grip. It also looks classy!
• To add a little more ~oomph~ to your otherwise plain ponytail, tie a scarf around it. Bonus points if it has a pretty print on it like Hyomin's!
• Space buns are cute enough on their own, but who says you have to stop there? Use bows to make the two sections stand out even more!
• Eunha's bejeweled clip provides a nice contrast against her jet-black hair.
