"AleXa is so much stronger than expected of a rookie, making it possible for her to compete in the U.S. market," says ICM Partners' Jon Pleeter.

After making her official debut on the K-pop scene just five months ago -- and landing her first Billboard chart hit -- AleXa is linking up with a major U.S. partnership.

The rising solo star who was introduced with a powerful cyborg-rebel-diva persona on first single "Bomb" has signed with ICM Partners, Billboard can exclusively reveal today (March 3).

The agency's primary priority for the 23-year-old Oklahoma native and former Produce 48 competitor will be assisting in her crossover to the U.S. market not only as a singer, but in areas like TV, movies, festivals and more. ICM is home to fellow international names like Nicki Minaj, Khalid, Kehlani and Yuna.
