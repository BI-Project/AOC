Chan: Drawing! I’m interested in any kind of drawing — I get inspired by the cities we visit and draw about that. (Note: These are a few of his illustrations above!)

Donghun: Reforming. It could be clothing, it could be a drawing — I like taking something and putting in my input and then making something new.

Kim Byeongkwan: Social media! I’m very interactive with our fans by social media so that’s what I’m doing right now.

Jun: I’ve started to produce music again, so I’m making songs. It was something that I did before, but because of our tight schedule I couldn’t do it. I’m getting back into it!

Kim Byeongkwan: I’m a bit tired because I can’t sleep [when Jun's producing songs]! Last night Jun was singing for three hours!

Wow: Writing and drawing. A mixture of both concepts.
