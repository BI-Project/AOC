Speak anything against a K-pop idol and you’d be spammed by their loyal fans. Now that the power of these stans has been established, someone out there is using the energy for a massive social media rebellion.

The influence of the K-pop fandom has been noticed by the hacktivist collective called ‘Anonymous’ on Twitter, who is now cashing in via allegiance.

Anonymous wrote on the micro blogging site, "Calling all #OpFanCam armies: The Trump loyalists, fascists, and Nazis have created a hashtag called #EXPOSEANTIFA it's time to invade. Show them the true power of K-Pop, Anime, and Taylor Swift."
