A new film about the Korean pop industry is in development from Scooter Braun’s SB Projects and Epic Magazine.

According to Deadline, the film’s story will follow an Asian-American college student in the US who becomes a top competitor on South Korea’s toughest K-pop competition show. She chases her dreams of becoming a K-pop star, despite her family’s disapproval.

The currently untitled K-pop film was picked up by Fox and will be directed by Seoul Searching’s Benson Lee and written by Elyse Hollander, with Scooter Braun and James Shin producing. Elyse Hollander’s past writing credits include Blonde Ambition and Murder on the Dance Floor.

“We’ve found great partners in Epic and Fox 2000 to showcase the world of K-pop,” Braun said, according to Variety. “We are excited to tap into Elyse’s talent to pull back the curtain on the genre at a time when it’s on the rise globally and give fans a story fueled by the excitement of K-pop music.”

“Scooter Braun is the perfect person to help audiences experience the thrill and wildness of K-pop,” said Joshua Davis, who alongside Arthur Spector is also producing the film on behalf of Epic Magazine. “He’s a visionary in the music space, and Epic couldn’t have found a better partner in our quest to tell this incredible story.”

Braun is best known as a talent manager in music, having worked with Justin Bieber, Kanye West, and Ariana Grande. In K-pop, he has previously worked with Psy and CL. Braun’s working relationship with CL has been controversial among some fans who’ve accused him of blocking the release of new music. Last year, Braun purchased Taylor Swift’s master recordings, and was heavily criticsed by the singer.
