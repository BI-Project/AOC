Despite being out and proud, Holland has achieved success- a majority of it coming from overseas. His music video ‘Neverland’ , which features a homosexual relationship, has over 12 million views, even though it received a 19+ rating in Korea for depicting a gay kiss. He currently has over 800 thousand subscribers on his YouTube channel and a million followers on Instagram. Holland’s surplus of fans made it possible to crowdfund £80,000 to fund his first mini-album as he still isn’t financially supported by a label. To add to his success, Holland earned a top spot on the 2018 Dazed 100 list , which celebrates pioneers of modern youth culture.

Although his music falls under the Korean pop genre, it could also be described as K-Indie. It definitely doesn’t have a mainstream feel to it and feels more alternative than pop, although it includes catchy pop-style beats. His lyrics are inspired by his experience of being gay in conservative South Korea and the struggles that come with that, as well as celebrating gay love. In the video for the single ‘I’m Not Afraid’, he also features other members of the LGBT community.

This message that being gay is normal isn’t just important for South Korea but all over the world as people live in homophobic countries, societies, or families. Anyone who has ever felt like an outcast because of who they are can find solace in Holland’s music.
