• Two Tiktokers have come under fire for appearing to lift choreography from K-pop girl group Apink as part of a new dance challenge.
• Fans were swift to call out the similarities between the two dances, and creator @jazlynebaybee later gave credit to Apink both in the comments of her original video and in the description of a repost of the dance.
• The incident is part of a common problem on TikTok with crediting dances, which spread quickly across the app.

Two TikTok creators, @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice, came under fire Monday for posting a video featuring a dance challenge that appears to have been lifted from a bit of choreography performed by K-pop girl group Apink. The pair posted videos of a two-person dance on each of their respective accounts, with @ashlynmarieprice calling it a "sister challenge," shouting out TikTok sisters Charli and Dixie D'Amelio in the description to do it as well. However, fans were quick to point out the similarities between the dance they performed and choreography from K-pop girl group Apink's latest single, "Dumhdurum."

The dance in question has already gone viral in K-pop fan communities on Twitter for its mind-bending choreography. "Dumhdurum" was choreographed by Freemind, a studio that recently posted the original choreo demo for the song and has worked on other K-pop titles like fromis_9's "Fun."

Upon finding both of @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice's videos, which have received approximately 75,000 and 7,200 likes, respectively, Apink fans (known by their fandom name, Pink Panda) were quick to call out the similarities between the dances in the comments and on Twitter. Both creators responded to commentors on TikTok videos, making comments like "okay TikTok cops" or "tell that to everyone else who uses different songs to different dances and routine." News of the dance video quickly spread across stan Twitter, with fans encouraging others to call out both creators.

Eventually, @jazlynebaybee gave credit in the comments of her own post, where she wrote, "Thank you for the inspiration @official_apink2011 choreographed @fm_thai76 & @juice0425." On Tuesday morning, she re-uploaded the dance, this time using "Dumhdurum" as the audio and crediting Apink in the description. In a TikTok livestream, she said that she came across the dance on TikTok, where it was set to the sound that she and @ashlynmarieprice danced to. "I would have totally done it to their song, I just didn't know it was to that song. When I saw it on TikTok, there was no credit, no nothing, I just thought it was an old clip," she said.

Insider has reached out to both @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice and will update with any comment.

This is far from the first time creators have been accused of lifting dances from other sources on TikTok. The most famous example is that of the "Renegade" dance, which was created by Jalaiah Harmon and posted on Instagram before another creator brought it to TikTok without credit. "Renegade" eventually became the biggest dance on the app, and Jalaiah eventually did get mainstream credit, but there were months between when the dance came to TikTok in October and when became well-known as its creator around Feb. 2020.

That's not to say that Apink, a famous girl group, faces the same kind of consequences of having a dance taken as a small creator — the swift fandom backlash against @jazlynebaybee and @ashlynmarieprice is testament to that. However, the full incident is just another notch in TikTok's dance crediting problem, in which dances are frequently picked up by creators who popularize them without giving credit to the original creators.

• A mysterious fake K-pop girl group fooled fans for days, and this isn't the first time it's happened
