K-pop superstar Taeyeon has cancelled two concerts in Bangkok over health concerns as the world is battling the spread of the lethal coronavirus.

SM True, which promoted her concerts in Bangkok, announced the decision to defer the concerts planned for Feb 22-23 to later dates due to concerns over the virus.

"The safety and health of artists, audiences and staff is our top priority and concern," the organisers posted a Facebook message.

Taeyeon, the former member of girl group Girls' Generation, planned The Unseen concerts at Thunder Dome Muang Thong Thani.

She was the second artist from South Korea who cancelled the concerts in Thailand and other Asian countries after GOT7.

GOT7 had planned their concerts at Rajamangala National Stadium on Feb 15-16 before they decided to cancel the shows.
