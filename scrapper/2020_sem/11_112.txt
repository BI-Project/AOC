K-pop & R&B soloist Jamie has announced her new single, teasing a futuristic concept for her second release at Warner Music Korea.

It hasn’t been long since we saw Jamie express her colors and enjoy her elements on screen, and we won’t have to wait long to meet her again. After teasing new music on her social media earlier this week, Jamie has announced her new single ‘Apollo 11’, out on November 11th.

‘Apollo 11’ will be Jamie’s second K-pop release since signing with Warner Music Korea earlier this year. The first was September’s ‘Numbers’ with Changmo, shortly after changing her stage name from Park Jimin to Jamie. The revamp came after almost a year of leaving K-pop behemoth JYP Entertainment.

“I wouldn’t say that Jimin was a fake version of me, though,” she said, speaking to Forbes earlier this year about why this ‘upgrade’ was needed.

“Of course, that is another me. But it was something that didn’t show off who I am, it was something that maybe people wanted to see. I never really felt 100 percent me while singing in those Jimin years.” she said.

“But I don’t regret it, because I think that it was the only time that I can sing those songs, when I was in my early ‘10s and teens. Now I’m in my twenties, I just want to show who I really am and what I want to talk about. My life, my songs. It’s just really fun. I’ve been telling everyone that it’s like the duality of me.” she added.

While we’re yet to see any video teasers, Park teased the release through aptly themed pictures. The first featured an astronaut, while the second painted a more futuristic vibe with Park as the focus.

‘Apollo 11’ is out on Wednesday, November 11th.
