Making their debut in 2016, Blackpink consists of members Jennie, Rosé, Jisoo, and Lisa. In just four years they've become a global sensation, setting YouTube streaming records and collaborating with Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, and Cardi B. The four-member ensemble also became the second girl group from YG Entertainment and the first Korean girl group to perform at Coachella last year. Always on stage or in music videos with fierce and feminine fashion, Blackpink has made hot pants, crop tops, and glittery embellishments some of their K-pop style calling cards. Beyond music, the individual members are ambassadors for brands like Chanel (Jennie), Saint Laurent (Rosé), Dior (Jisoo), and Celine and Bulgari (Lisa). With a new Netlfix documentary, Blackpink: Light up the Sky, their loyal fanbase (known as the "Blinks") can chart their rise from young trainees to the recognizable idols they are today.
