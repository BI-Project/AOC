MANILA - Korean pop legends BIGBANG will be performing in this year's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, their agency confirmed Friday.

YG Entertainment posted a photo of the lineup for this year's music festival, with BIGBANG performing on April 10 and 17.

Korean hip-hop group Epik High will also perform in Coachella on April 12 and 19.

The group's upcoming performance in Coachella marks the end of their four-year hiatus as the members have fulfilled their military service.

Member T.O.P was discharged in July 2019, followed by G-Dragon in October, and Daesung and Taeyang in November.

BIGBANG was originally a 5-man group but member Seungri left the band and retired from the music industry in March after he was accused of sex bribery.

BIGBANG, which debuted in 2006, often topped the South Korean music charts and gained a huge following before members began to enter mandatory military service in 2017.
