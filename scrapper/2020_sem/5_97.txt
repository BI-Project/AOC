K-pop is officially taking over May, and even some new characters are coming to play.

"Who Dis?" Vine Entertainment announced a new five-member girl group called Secret Number will officially debut on May 19 with its new single, while About Entertainment comes out with another all-female squad REDSQUARE on the same day with its new album Prequel.

But for those already in the big leagues, NCT 127 plans on releasing the boy band's deluxe sophomore album The 2nd Album Repackage 'NCT #127 Neo Zone: The Final Round' on May 19 with four new tracks and two physical versions of the LP with special artwork, photos and other goodies for fans. Tomorrow x Together also has a second mini-album on the way on May 18 titled The Dream Chapter: Eternity.
