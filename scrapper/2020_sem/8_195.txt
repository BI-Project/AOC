The never-ending K-pop wave continues to sweep the entire globe with its perfectly produced videos, crisp dances, and catchy tunes. Today, K-pop supergroup SuperM have released their long-awaited new single “100,” which is another step closer in the countdown to the release of their first full album later this year.

SuperM is not only a supergroup because it fits the name, but also because they were formed as a combo of one of Korea’s top production companies SM Entertainment’s most successful groups. In 2019, SM Entertainment announced that members from their groups Shinee, Exo, WayV, and NC217 will be joining together to create SuperM. The groups have respectively sold millions of records, sold out hundreds of tours across the world, and have been majorly successful inside and outside of Korea.

Today, they released their new single “100,” which celebrates all things fans love about K-pop: flawless choreography, a mix between rap and harmonizing voices, bright colors and a group of performers excelling at their craft. If you ever had to introduce someone to K-pop, this would surely make a fine example of the genre.

The single is available today on all major streaming platforms and you can check out the video below:
