Pentagon is rumoured to be in the lineup for survival show Road To Kingdom.

The nine member group – Hui, Jinho, Hongseok, Shinwon, Yanan, Yeo One, Yuto, Kino, and Wooseok – are reportedly in talks to take part in the show, which will culminate in a boy group version of Queendom.

Other K-pop boy groups ONEUS, ONF, Golden Child, The Boyz and TOO are also said to be in talks for the final lineup.

Road to Kingdom will have a similar format to the survival show Queendom from last year where girl groups competed against each other in a comeback battle, releasing music on various streaming platforms at the same time.

The series was won by MAMAMOO with Oh My Girl coming second.

The Road to Kingdom champ will get straight through to follow up show Kingdom.

Previously SF9 and AB6IX were also linked to the show, but both groups decided not to take part.

FNC Entertainment, SF9’s agency, said in a statement: ‘It is true that it was under discussion, but the decision has already been made to not participate.’

Filming on Road to Kingdom is scheduled to start on 20 March.

Pentagon made headlines in 2018 after member E’Dawn was revealed to have been dating singer Hyuna since 2016.

Cube Entertainment removed him from a fan event following backlash from Korean fans, and despite a petition from international fans to keep him in the group it was eventually announced he had left.
