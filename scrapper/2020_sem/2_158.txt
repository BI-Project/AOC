^That's Kang Hyun-gyu directing a promo video for A.C.E! He also creates/edits hilarious behind-the-scenes videos (he's directly credited onscreen, btw).

According to his CJ bio, he initially trained himself in underwater photography (which obviously came in handy for the submerged basement scenes) and then made the leap to film crew member.

We're truly blessed by his range of work!!! H/T SBS PopAsia.
