Big Hit Entertainment, the South Korean company that houses the record-breaking act BTS and several other K-pop acts, filed for an initial public offering (IPO), the Korea Exchange said on May 27.

The music-forward company has been long-rumored to be planning to go public, and recent executive-level restructurings and acquisitions have been seen as Big Hit’s continued expansion to become one of the most prominent South Korean entertainment companies.

Reuters reports that JPMorgan, NH Investment & Securities, and Korea Investment & Securities are the underwriters for the offering. There is currently no announced timeline or size of the planned IPO, and it is unknown how the global coronavirus pandemic will affect expectations.

In 2019, Big Hit Entertainment marked its highest business performance to date, reporting revenue worth $507.9 million USD and an operating profit of $85.4 million.

The South Korean company, which was founded in 2005 by chairman-CEO Bang Si-Hyuk, struggled for many years but saw major success in the late 2010s with the rise of BTS. The company launched its second boy band TOMORROW X TOGETHER, typically known as TXT, last year and upcoming boy bands and girl groups are currently in the works. Recent acquisitions have resulted in popular K-pop acts GFriend, Seventeen, and NU’EST coming under Big Hit’s auspices.

Currently, the company’s largest shareholders are Bang and gaming giant Netmarble, which is headed by Bang’s cousin Bang Jun-Hyuk.

Big Hit Entertainment’s IPO will result in the company joining only a handful of other South Korean entertainment companies that have gone public, including the historic “Big 3” K-pop companies, SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, YG Entertainment as well as FNC Entertainment and Cube Entertainment.
