K-pop accounted for a healthy chunk of Twitter’s soundtrack for 2019, as the social network said there were 6.1 billion related tweets during the year, up 15% from the 2018 total.

Twitter head of global K-pop partnerships YeonJeong Kim said in a blog post, “While K-pop gained popularity in South Korea 25 years ago, it is only in recent times through the power of millennial fans worldwide that K-pop-related conversations have gained traction across the world on Twitter.”

Kim pointed out that the Golden Tweet for 2019, or the year’s most-retweeted tweet, was BTS member Jungkook’s video of him dancing to Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy.”

Twitter hosted 76 #TwitterBlueroom sessions with K-pop bands and artists in 2019, featuring exclusive interviews and question-and-answer sessions.

Kim said K-pop supergroup SuperM broke the record for the most-watched K-pop #TwitterBlueroom, topping 2 million viewers, adding that Twitter co-founders CEO Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone joined GOT7 during their #TwitterBlueroom session, which tallied more than 1.1 million views.

K-pop awards shows and events made their mark on Twitter, as well, with 40 million tweets related to KCON 2019, as well as 28 million views of videos generated during the event, topped by 102 million tweets from Oct. 24, when voting for the MAMAs started, through Dec. 4, the day of the event.

The three countries behind the most K-pop-related tweets in 2019 were Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia.

The most-discussed accounts last year belonged to BTS, EXO and GOT7.

Finally, Kim said the fastest-rising K-pop accounts on the platform last year were Blackpink, SuperM and Tomorrow X Together.
