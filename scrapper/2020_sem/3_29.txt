K-pop is coming to the Houston Rodeo! But we don't have to say that because everyone already knows. When the line-up was announced and the first-ever K-pop group to perform at the rodeo was announced, it was huge news and for good reason. Houstonians are huge fans of NCT 127, so much so that there's going to be a k-pop cafe in Houston this weekend in honor of the "Cherry Bomb" singers.

NCT 127 is the massively popular K-pop group that's going to perform at the Houston Rodeo this weekend and Popfancy Dessert Bar is hosting an all-out NCT-themed cafe in Bellaire to celebrate.

There will be all kinds of sweet treats in honor of the different band members this March 7 and 8.

The cafe's super limited-edition menu has been posted on Popfancy's Instagram and includes Neo Zone pops, cakes, Cherry Bomb swirls, Wakey Wakey heart-shaped waffle pops, Simon Says ice cream swirls, and of course, NC Teas.

The fan cafe will also have giveaways where you can win free concert tickets to their Rodeo concert on March 10.

No fan event is complete without merchandise and there will be limited edition merch, vendors, and even a live DJ playing their biggest hits.

The first fifty people on both days will get some really sweet goodies including an exclusive lanyard and sticker.

The two-day event will be from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday and from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday.

However, due to the popularity of the event and their free fast passes selling out, they're opening another time slot on Sunday from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

The limited amount of fast passes are on a first come first serve basis so get there as early as you can!

If you can't get fast passes though that's fine because there will also be General Admission line where you can hang out and meet other fellow NCTzens.

If you're a stan, there's no better place to be than at this limited-time cafe decked out in your favorite singers!
