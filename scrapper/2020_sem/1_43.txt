MANILA -- The Philippines ranked fifth among the countries that were most engaged in talking about South Korean pop music on Twitter last year, according to the micro-blogging platform.

A report from Twitter showed that the Philippines was fifth among the “countries tweeting most about K-pop in 2019” after the United States at fourth place.

Thailand emerged as the country that “tweeted” most about K-pop, followed by the genre’s home South Korea. Indonesia, meanwhile, ranked third.

Completing the list were Brazil at rank six, Malaysia at seventh, Japan at eighth, Mexico at ninth, and Argentina at 10th.

For 2019, Twitter recorded a whopping 6.1 billion related tweets on K-pop, a 15% increase from 2018, the report added.

Yeon-Jeong Kim, head of Twitter's global K-pop partnerships, said the social network has served as a bridge between the K-pop industry and fans all over the world, which has enabled fans to get the latest news and drive conversation on the genre.

“Twitter will continuously drive various partnerships with top and emerging K-pop artists as well as global events like [the Mnet Asian Music Awards] and KCON to accelerate the rise of K-pop globally in 2020,” said Kim.

Boy band phenomenon BTS led the list of “most discussed K-pop accounts worldwide,” followed by EXO at second place.

Girl group Blackpink, meanwhile, topped the list of “fastest rising K-pop accounts worldwide.”

South Korean pop groups and television dramas have in recent years become widely popular across Asia, and, increasingly, beyond.
