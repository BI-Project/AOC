Joohoney is preparing to return to MONSTA X three months after he stepped away from the group.

The K-pop star went on hiatus in January as he had been suffering from ‘anxiety symptoms’.

The remaining members – Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon and I.M. – promoted as a five for the release of their first ever English-language album All About Luv in February this year.

Now their agency Starship Entertainment has confirmed that the rapper is ready to return as MONSTA X gears up for another comeback.

In a statement to South Korean media, the company said: ‘Joohoney is resuming activities. MONSTA X has begun preparations to make a comeback aimed for the first half of the year.’

Starship previously explained that his return to MONSTA X ‘will be based on his recovery status and professional opinion, which will also be conducted through careful consultation with Joohoney and the members.’

The Follow singers have been promoting as six members since Wonho left the boy group in 2019 amid drug allegations.

However he has since been cleared of all charges.

Explaining his decision to quit, he told Dispatch: ‘I’d hate to see MONSTA X collapse just because of me, so I thought I should leave the group as soon as possible so that they can continue their activities. I’d like to prevent the damage to them as much as I could.

‘I can confidently say that I have completely changed after meeting Monbebe (MONSTA X’s fans). I understood what it is like to be loved, and it made me want to live a good life every day.’
