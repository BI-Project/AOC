The Korea Times Music Festival at the Hollywood Bowl was set to feature performances by MOMOLAND, Ha Sungwoon and more in April.

Growing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus has led to the postponement of one of the biggest annual K-pop concerts in the U.S.

The Korea Times Music Festival announced that its concert scheduled for April 25 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles "has provisionally been postponed due to the increasing uncertainty threat of coronavirus." The annual musical festival, which is in its 18th year, had already announced the likes of K-pop girl group MOMOLAND, solo singer and former Wanna One member Ha Sungwoon and rock band No Brain, with the addition of more acts expected in the coming weeks.

The festival says, "Concert goers can opt for a refund or keep the existing tickets," noting that current tickets "will remain valid and transferable to the rescheduled concert date."
