Ever since Harry Styles dropped his very, um, sensual music video for "Watermelon Sugar" back in May, the singer's not-so-subtle lyrics have been on replay all summer. And while I'm admittedly not mad about it, a fresh approach is always welcome. So, allow me to introduce you to this sultry cover by Hwasa, a member of popular K-pop girl group Mamamoo, for a taste of the singer's impressive vocals and a moody take on the song. The singer released a retro-themed video of her own on Wednesday, just one day before the 10-year anniversary of the formation of Styles's former band One Direction. While Hwasa's rendition holds true to the original, her unique voice definitely adds a whole new vibe. Watch Hwasa's mesmerizing cover of "Watermelon Sugar" above.
