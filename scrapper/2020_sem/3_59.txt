ATEEZ star Jongho was pictured arriving at the airport in a wheelchair at Incheon International Airport as the K-pop group headed off on their world tour.

Jongho’s agency KQ Management previously announced on social media that the idol had suffered a leg injury.

His injury is believed to take around three to four months to heal.

But he’s not letting that deter him from joining the members on tour, and will be seated on stage at each stop.

Jongho joined the rest of the group on Thursday to make the journey overseas to Madrid, where they are due to perform on 14 March.

The members will also stop in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow.

Known for their inventive dance moves and frenetic stage presence, ATINY who get to see the guys live are in for a total treat

Also departing South Korea to head off on tour were girl group Everglow, who have released such bangers as Bon Bon Chocolat, Adios and more recently Dun Dun.

Members E:U, Sihyeon, Mia, Onda, Aisha and Yiren nailed their airport fashion as they arrived at the airport to a wall of paps.

Special mention goes to Onda who is still rocking her vibrant orange hair, teaming it with a short brown and blue denim jacket, black jeans and trainers.

Everglow, who are under agency Yuehua Entertainment, are embarking on their first ever world tour.

Starting 6 March the girl group will play in Dallas, stopping at Atlanta, Chicago and Jersey City before rounding things off in Los Angeles.
