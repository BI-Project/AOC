K/DA, the fictional League of Legends K-pop group, is planning a comeback on Aug. 27, according to a tweet from the official Twitter account.

The Twitter account has posted a single image of the K/DA logo, along with a date, saying that K/DA is having a comeback at 3 p.m. ET on Aug. 27. Specifically, it sounds like fans should expect a “pre-release single” called “The Baddest.” A “pre-release single” implies that a full album may be coming and, maybe, new skins for the K/DA quartet. True Damage, Riot Games’ other musical group, has some skins that feature Louis Vuitton designs, so it wouldn’t be too surprising to see K/DA return with some flashy designer clothes.

K/DA is Riot Games’ K-pop group set in the League of Legends universe. The group made its debut at the 2018 League of Legends World Championships in Seoul, and features four of the game’s champions, voiced by real singers, as a pop girl group. The video for its debut single, “Pop/Stars,” has amassed over 362 million views on YouTube and topped charts since its release.
