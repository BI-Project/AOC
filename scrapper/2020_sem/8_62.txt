Park Jin-young, founder and producer of JYP Entertainment, is poised to release a single "When We Disco" featuring K-pop diva Sunmi on Aug. 12, according to JYP.



The record label took to its official Twitter on Monday to float a teaser photo of the two dancing under glaring lights. "When We Disco" is a retro-flavored Euro-disco track, according to the company.



"When the song was in the final stage of preparation, Park's 'student' Sunmi contacted him and talked about their bygone days in the U.S.," JYP said in a statement. "After the talk, Park thought that their memory went well with the track's lyrics, so offered collaboration."



Sunmi debuted in 2007 as a member of now-defunct girl band Wonder Girls, which JYP Entertainment represented. The group began a career in the U.S. in 2009, but Sunmi quit it in 2010. She rejoined Wonder Girls in 2015 and stayed until its disbandment in 2017. The K-pop star began forging a solo career in 2013 with "24 hours" and dropped hits such as "Gashina" (2017).



Park debuted with the album "Blue City" in 1993 and rose to stardom thanks to hits including "She Was Pretty" (1996) and "Honey" (1998). He founded JYP, one of the "Big 3" music powerhouses here, in 1996 and launched a flurry of K-pop big names such as 2PM and TWICE.
