K-pop star Hong Jin-young has a new single out – but unlike poor Dua Lipa, isn’t having to promote it via lockdown.

The star has been celebrating new track Love Is Like a Petal in South Korea – one of a number of countries around the world to buck the full lockdown trend since coronavirus hit.

There was an early outbreak of cases in the country in late February and early March, but after extensive testing, the country has flattened the curve of new cases.

Hong, who was seen entering The KBS Broadcasting Station In Seoul to shoot a radio programme, is also known for songs like Love Tonight and Thumb Up.

The 34-year-old’s comeback track follows mass disruption to the global music industry.

For instance, Physical singer Dua has released her new album Love Nostalgia while stuck in a London Airbnb – it still charted amazingly. 



Lady Gaga, meanwhile, has pushed back the release of new album Chromatica until later in the year.

Other artists who have delayed albums include Alicia Keys, The 1975, Sam Smith, Alanis Morissette…

The list goes on.

However, some artists, like The Strokes and Charli XCX, are forging ahead by releasing new music – and now Hong, too.

Best of luck with the track, Hong, we love it.
