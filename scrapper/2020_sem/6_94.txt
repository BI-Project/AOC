The internet has become a powerful tool for activists around the world over the last few days, as Black Lives Matter protests across the United States have been beset upon by violent and aggressive police officers.

Videos of cops committing a range of violent acts — including shooting a journalist in the eye, tear-gassing a medical tent, and driving a car through protestors — have been posted online in an attempt to hold the police force to account.

Elsewhere, the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on Instagram and Twitter has been used by Black activists to share charities that can be donated to, recipes for a balm to apply to eyes that have been hit with pepper spray, and meet-up spots designated for protest co-ordination.

It should be noted at this stage that the majority of these actions have been undertaken by Black activists whose role is sometimes downplayed by international media.

More recently, another group that has become involved in these digital activist movements is K-pop stans.

Fans of bands like BLACKPINK and BTS first became involved en masse in the current Black Lives Matter protests when they submitted fancams to police “snitch” websites designed to share tips with law enforcement, making these websites significantly less effective, and even temporarily shutting them down.

Now, they have applied that same energy to flooding hashtags on Twitter that are being used to share pro-police, pro-Trump information.

The call-out for the co-ordinated action came from a number of sources, but most notably from @stayy_zz and @1tG!rl, two Twitter users who shared the plan with their followers.

Within moments, the stans got to action.

Now, when you search hashtags like #BlueLivesMatter, which were once used to show support for the violent and racist American police force, you will find hundreds of fancams instead. And the number is only growing.

Think of it as digital signal scrambling. And post a K-pop fancam of your own, why don’t you?
