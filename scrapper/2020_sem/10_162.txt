If you've been following along with our TikTok Challenge Challenge series, you'd now that majority of the K-Pop groups‚Äî*ahem* girl groups‚Äîwe've had have absolutely crushed our game. When CLC came to play, they totally dominated. And TWICE also shocked us with their quick, on point dance skills. So, on that note, we can only assume that this challenge will be a piece of cake for our latest contestants aka the members of Loona because...who run the world?? üòè

Heads up: There are 11 people who make up the group, so it was quite the competition! To start it all off, Heejin went up first and was given a more complicated dance routine from le Tok. Think of the Savage choreo times 1000, LOL. We had Hyunlin, our next competitor, doing an easier one and obviously she perfected it. Yeojin was a lil intimidated when she saw her assigned choreo, but she didn't let it stop her from trying her best! TBH, I thought she did well‚Äîespecially for only having one minute to learn it.
