Grammys, Oscars, Daesangs — awards season is rolling to a close, but that doesn’t mean that all of the fun is over! There are plenty of other things to celebrate, so we thought you might want to mix it up by hosting a little award show of your own. The categories are all settled, and the nominees have arrived — all that’s left is for you to pick the winners! But there’s just one little catch: this isn’t a show like any other you’ve ever been to. Let’s raise a glass to the winners of these 10 totally random awards, and we’ll even give you one too!

Which award did you take home tonight? Tell us in the comments!
