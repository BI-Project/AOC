The BTS bandmates continued to play games in the 96th episode of “Run BTS!”The first activity of the day was putting together tops and spinning them. But Jin, who as master of ceremonies had to decide which tops to give to which players, was torn between Jimin and Jungkook.Jimin, winner of the last game, had the first pick, Jin said, but their bandmates protested. Then the youngest member of BTS asked to go first as a special favor.“I will be hurt if you let him,” said Jimin, putting pressure on Jin.The oldest member suggested going around the group to see which top each band member wanted, but took the special one as soon as he laid eyes on it -- sending everyone into a bout of laughter.“Just give me any!” said Suga, exasperated. Jungkook was happy when Jimin let him have the top they’d both wanted before.Suga was the first to finish making his top, but he could not make it spin for some reason. V’s face fell when his broke in two, while Jimin boasted about his dazzling top -- only to see it fall apart when he spun it.Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/179732.Cho Seung-youn entertained fans by taking on two projects: creating glass decorations as himself and making super-sweet coffee as Cho Woodz, his stage name.“When I finish making the picture and my name, it will be used as a new banner for my (social media) account,” he explained as he starting work on the decorations.He began with his name, carefully outlining the letters, confident about his skills although the staffers predicted that he would probably fail.“I have watched someone on YouTube creating stuff with 3D pens,” said the performer, giving himself some encouragement.“I got the hang of it,” he said soon after he began. He made a lot of progress in 30 minutes.“While we wait for this to dry a little, I will make ‘dalgona’ coffee,” said Cho, taking a shot at making the sugary coffee drink that is trending on social media.Watch the full clip at https://www.vlive.tv/video/180353.The bandmates of Victon returned to “Idol Radio,” hosted by special DJ Kang Seung-yoon of Winner, bearing good news.The host congratulated them on coming in first on a music chart program. In response, the six bandmates howled at the top of their lungs.Over the past four months, there have been a number of things to celebrate, said the host, including a successful first stand-alone concert in January.“We were extremely nervous, especially since it was our first, and I frankly don’t remember what went on onstage,” confided Kang Seung-sik.“I tend to worry a lot and really was fretting up until the last minute. But when I was onstage (and saw the fans) I literally felt a thrill course through my body,” recalled Heo Chan.At the DJ’s nudging, Kang Seung-sik also asked everyone to congratulate them on having every track from the album land on the music charts.Watch the full video at https://www.vlive.tv/video/180086.Shuhua and Soojin of (G)I-dle took to V Live after practice.Miyeon and Soyeon joined them on the sofa and said hello to viewers, saying they were making a special appearance before leaving to eat some tteokbokki.“I was wearing a mask while practicing and I could barely breathe,” said Shuhua.
