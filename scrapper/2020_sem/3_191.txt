The board of directors of South Korean entertainment company SM Entertainment appointed a new CEO and CMO on Tuesday (March 10).

Lee Seong-su, also known as Chris Lee, will reportedly take over as chief executive officer. He will lead alongside chief marketing officer Tak Young-joon.

The changes follow prior shifts last year at SM, where the executive level staff also moved around following outrage from shareholders over a series of financial decisions investors felt didn’t align with their values.

Kim Young-min and Nam So-young formerly served as co-directors of the company as of last year, with Kim acting as CEO and Nam as CMO.

Lee previously served as an A&R executive at SM as well as CEO of Culture Technology Group Asia (CTGA) Europe. He also sits on the company’s board of directors. Tak formerly was allegedly the head of artist management, and also served on the board. Both have been at SM since the early ‘00s, and worked with many of the company's acts.

Since the 1990s, SM Entertainment has fronted the rise of K-pop and is currently the home to the likes of popular K-pop acts such as EXO, SuperM, NCT, Red Velvet, and many others.

Though global markets are dipping, SM Entertainment’s stock rose minimally following the announcement of the new leadership.
