The Japanese singer based in South Korea revealed her simple and fuss-free skin care routine has just a basic couple of steps literally everybody can recreate. Read on to find out how she gets her flawless and glassy skin!

To begin with, Momo says to Allure, "Every day is different" because of her hectic schedule.

First, the K-POP star begins with a simple cleanser to take off her makeup and grime. But she makes sure not to wash her face for too long too! "I always keep a small timer next to me to tell me how many seconds I have to wash each part of my face," she singer told Harper's Bazaar.

After patting her face dry, Momo wipes her face clean with a toner on a cotton pad that makes for an all-in one. Her toner gives her a bright complexion, smoothens out her skin and gets rid of the remaining dirt.

Post that, Momo believes in the simplest thing to put on her face before she heads to bed - lotion.
