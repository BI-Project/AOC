DUBAI: Organizers of Super Concert, which would have featured top K-pop groups Super Junior, RGP, NCT 127, Laboum and Junset, have postponed the event scheduled on March 20 amid global coronavirus concerns.

The decision was made “in line with the international measures being taken to ensure the public’s health and safety,” organizers at Coca-Cola Arena, where the event was supposed to take place, tweeted.

Ticket holders will receive a full refund from their point of purchase. “Please allow for 10 working days for the refund to reach your account before contacting your point of purchase,” they added.

The rescheduled date is yet to be announced.
