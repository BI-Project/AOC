• K-pop, now one of the most popular genres in the world, has many beloved stars.
• The industry and fans alike expect performers to keep a well-polished, professional image — and most do.
• But scandals emerge regularly — including sexual violence, blackmail, alleged drug trafficking, and more.
• K-pop's biggest stars are never far from the spotlight, or the industry's dark side.

While much of the music industry has been in a decline, K-pop continues to thrive. The phenomenon draws around $5 billion annually, and it's considered the seventh-most-popular music genre in the world. This year, according to estimates, the audience for "Hallyu," or Korean pop culture, will reach 100 million – or roughly double the population of South Korea.

In North America, the industry has exploded in popularity and profitability, and American pop darlings and their labels have taken note: In 2019, Lizzo and Lil Nas X teamed up with K-pop superstars for remixes to their songs "Truth Hurts" and "Old Town Road," respectively. BTS, arguably the most famous of South Korea's boy bands, has collaborated with Halsey and the Chainsmokers.

Ever in the spotlight, K-pop stars have been subjected to increasing pressure and scrutiny as the industry angles to become dominant on the global stage. The industry and fans alike expect them to have a polished public image.

Though the vast majority of K-pop artists maintain sterling reputations, the pressure of performance and image-maintenance can be too much to bear. The genre has been witness to a number of deaths by suicide in recent years, and scandals regularly emerge.

If K-pop artists are illuminated by the limelight, they are also never far from the industry's dark underbelly. From corruption and sexual violence to alleged drug trafficking, here are the most shocking K-pop incidents of the last several years.
