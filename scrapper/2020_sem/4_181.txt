Trolls World Tour is full of catchy earworms just like its predecessor - here's a breakdown of every song on the soundtrack. The film, which is just as glittery and fun as 2016's Trolls, takes place at some point after the events of original movie.

In Trolls World Tour, Poppy is happily ruling as queen of her tribe, with her best friend Branch at her side. Thanks to an invitation to Queen Barb's world tour, Poppy learns her tribe is just one of six Troll tribes - pop, rock, classical, funk, techno, and country. Each tribe has a string that represents their genre of music. Barb intends to steal the strings from each tribe to force all trolls to come together under her music: rock. Branch and Poppy set out to convince Barb to unite all music, instead of destroying what's different than hers.

As the film encompasses a wide variety of music genres, so does its soundtrack. Here's every song from Trolls World Tour that appears on the soundtrack.
• "One More Time" - Daft Punk: The Pop Trolls sing this song at a party. Queen Barb's entrance interrupts the song.
• "Rock You Like a Hurricane" - Scorpions: Barb sings this song as she drops in on the Pop Trolls' party and informs them of her plan to acquire each of the strings so she can rule over every Troll.
• "Trolls Just Want to Have Fun": The song is an ode to "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper. Poppy sings it as her intro to the movie, with a little help from Branch, as he sings about his feelings for Poppy.

• "Don't Slack" - Anderson .Paak and Justin Timberlake: This song plays as the film fades into the credits.

Unsurprisingly, given Trolls World Tour's cast is made up of musical artists or actors with a background in music, these songs are integral to the film, and will be earworms for all who listen. Music is an intrinsic part of the Trolls franchise, and that continues with the Trolls World Tour soundtrack.
