K-pop stars who died way too young

The world of K-pop isn't always kind to its young stars. While appearing in a popular South Korean music group can rocket performers to celebrity status in Asia and beyond, the road to stardom is notoriously difficult, with aspiring performers signing their childhood and teenage years away to train with management groups in hopes of landing a coveted spot in a boy or girl group. Add the punishing body image standards and social media hate often heaped on young singers, and it's no wonder that K-pop is sometimes branded as a "toxic" environment for its stars.

From freak accidents to heartbreaking, self-inflicted deaths, many K-pop stars have tragically passed away before their time, with a string of suicides in 2019 drawing international attention to the well-being of the genre's biggest names. With several K-pop performers announcing hiatuses due to mental health concerns by the following year, perhaps things are changing in the once-merciless music community. In June 2020, Bang Si-hyuk, the founder of the internationally-beloved boy band BTS, announced his commitment to "do [his] best as a producer who manages the mental health of the participants rather than know-how or skills."

One thing is for sure: enough K-pop stars have sadly died for the industry to take notice. These are some of the most tragic losses of young talents in K-pop.
