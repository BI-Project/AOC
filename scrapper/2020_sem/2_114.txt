Rising K-Pop stars The Boyz love having so many members in their team.

The boy group boasts 11 members: Sangyeon, Jacob, Younghoon, Hyunjae, Juyeon, Kevin, New, Q, Juhaknyeon, Sunwoo, and Eric.

Having all these performers in one group makes for some impressive choreography and an exciting range of vocals.

And according to the boys themselves the large group allows for ’11 different interpretations of a song’, so we get to hear their concepts from a wide range of viewpoints.

They also gave some insight into their stage outfits and how it reflects them as idols.

‘Yes they do reflect our team’s personality and from 소년 (Boy), to D.D.D and also Tattoo, it really shows our growth and just how when we’re all together as a team and you see us together, our stage outfits elevate us even more and give fans even more to think about and look out for.’

Kevin added: ‘I think even though it seems like we’re matching, we have little variations that reflects each member’s personality which I think is cool.’

Read on to find out what else they had to say.

Having impressed their fans with White, The Boyz are gearing up for their upcoming album Reveal, which will be their first full-length album.

And it looks like their wish to write more songs for the group has come true, with Sunwoo and Eric both contributing raps to the songs Scar and Spring Snow.
