Blackpink scored its first top 40 single when the girl group's comeback single "How You Like That" debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 (dated July 8). But which K-pop group could make it to No. 1 on the chart?

BTS has come close in the past three top 10 hits -- "ON" from the boy band's latest LP Map of the Soul: 7 reaching all the way to No. 4 in March, the Halsey-assisted "Boy With Luv" securing the No. 8 spot last April, and "Fake Love" clocking in at No. 10 in June 2018.

Red Velvet, Monsta X, Seventeen, Twice, EXO and LOONA have topped Billboard's World Digital Song Sales and/or Japan Hot 100 charts in their careers, so crossing over to the U.S. all-genre tally is possible. Meanwhile, SuperM already made that major linguistic crossover last October when the supergroup's first album SuperM: The 1st Mini Album topped the Billboard 200 chart.
